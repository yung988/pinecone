    "summary": "In the vicinity of merging neutron strar binaries or supernova remnants, gravitational waves can interact with the prevailing strong magnetic fields. The resulting partial conversion of gravitational waves into electromagnetic (radio) waves might prove to be an indirect way of detecting gravitational waves from such sources.   Another interesting interaction considered in this article is the excitation of magnetosonic plasma waves by a gravitational wave passing through the surrounding plasma. The transfer of gravitational wave energy into the plasma might help to fuel the `fireball' of electromagnetic radiation observed in gamma ray bursts. In the last section of the article, a dispersion relation is derived for such magnetosonic plasma waves driven by a gravitational wave.",

    "summary": "Gravitational waves are oscillations of space-time that are created, for example, in black hole mergers. If these waves travel through another massive astrophysical object, they will undergo an effect called gravitational lensing, that will distort and deflect them. This effect can create multiple images of the gravitational wave signal, and interference between them. In this document, we describe the sonification process of the gravitational lensing effect on gravitational waves. Sonification is the translation of data into sound. The wave nature of sound creates interference between waves in a natural way. This has allowed us to reproduce the interference produced by the superposition of gravitational wave images, characteristic of the gravitational lensing effect.

It is expected that more and more gravitational-wave events will be detected by currently existing and planned gravitational-wave detectors. The gravitational waves open a new window to explore the Universe and various mysteries will be disclosed through the gravitational-wave detection, combined with other cosmological probes. The gravitational-wave physics is not only related to gravitation theory, but also is closely tied to fundamental physics, cosmology and astrophysics. In this review article, three kinds of sources of gravitational waves and relevant physics will be discussed, namely gravitational waves produced during the inflation and preheating phases of the Universe, the gravitational waves produced during the first-order phase transition as the Universe cools down and the gravitational waves from the three phases: inspiral, merger and ringdown of a compact binary system, respectively. We will also discuss the gravitational waves as a standard siren to explore the evolution of the Universe.",

    "summary": "The gravitational constant variation means the breakdown of the strong equivalence principle. As the cornerstone of general relativity, the validity of general relativity can be examined by studying the gravitational constant variation. Such variations have the potential to affect both the generation and propagation of gravitational waves. In this paper, our focus lies on the effect of gravitational constant variation specifically on the propagation of gravitational waves. We employ two analytical methods, namely based on the Fierz-Pauli action and the perturbation of Einstein-Hilbert action around Minkowski spacetime, both leading to the the same gravitational wave equation. By solving this equation, we find the effects of gravitational constant variation on gravitational wave propagation. The result is consistent with previous investigations based on Maxwell-like equations for gravitational waves. Notably, we find that small variations in the gravitational constant result in an amplitude correction at the leading order and a phase correction at the sub-leading order for gravitational waves. These results provide valuable insights for probing gravitational constant variation and can be directly applied to gravitational wave data analysis.",

The electromagnetic wave equations in the background gravitational waves are studied. We find that the expansion and contraction of wave lengths are always synchronous with the objects it measures. The background of the gravitational waves leads to dissipation and dispersion in the propagation of electromagnetic wave. The phase of the gravitational waves control the dissipation term and dispersion term in the telegrapher's equation. The linearly polarized laser beam propagating in the direction of the incoming gravitational waves can give a possible measurement on the local metric. In case of the pulsed beats passing by, the relaxation time is greater than the period of the gravitational waves, thus the detector may only show a signal of the modulation of the beats. Finally we proposed a non-local interference experiment to detect the high-frequency gravitational waves. It is similar to the measurement of redshift caused by gravitation. Together with the ordinary detector, it will give us further and mutually measurements of the gravitational waves.",

Gravitational-wave burst signals often have an unknown waveform shape, and unknown gravitational-wave energy, due to unknown or very complicated progenitor astrophysics. Potential sources of gravitational-wave bursts include core-collapse supernovae, cosmic strings, fast radio bursts, eccentric binary systems, and gravitational-wave memory.

    "title": "Gravitational wave detector response in terms of spacetime Riemann   curvature",
    "summary": "Gravitational wave detectors are typically described as responding to gravitational wave metric perturbations, which are gauge-dependent and --- correspondingly --- unphysical quantities. This is particularly true for ground-based interferometric detectors, like LIGO, space-based detectors, like LISA and its derivatives, spacecraft doppler tracking detectors, and pulsar timing arrays detectors. The description of gravitational waves, and a gravitational wave detector's response, to the unphysical metric perturbation has lead to a proliferation of false analogies and descriptions regarding how these detectors function, and true misunderstandings of the physical character of gravitational waves.   Here we provide a fully physical and gauge invariant description of the response of a wide class of gravitational wave detectors in terms of the Riemann curvature, the physical quantity that describes gravitational phenomena in general relativity. In the limit of high frequency gravitational waves, the Riemann curvature separates into two independent gauge invariant quantities: a \"background\" curvature contribution and a \"wave\" curvature contribution. In this limit the gravitational wave contribution to the detector response reduces to an integral of the gravitational wave contribution of the curvature along the unperturbed photon path between components of the detector. The description presented here provides an unambiguous physical description of what a gravitational wave detector measures and how it operates, a simple means of computing corrections to a detectors response owing to general detector motion, a straightforward way of connecting the results of numerical relativity simulations to gravitational wave detection, and a basis for a general and fully relativistic pulsar timing formula.",

The non-detection of such loud memory bursts throughout the operation of LIGO/Virgo rules out the gravitational-wave explanation for the high-frequency events detected by Goryachev et al.

Regarding the gravitational constant, previous works focused on the effect of the gravitational constant variation on the gravitational wave generation. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the gravitational constant variation on the gravitational wave propagation. The Maxwell-like equation that describes the propagation of gravitational waves is extended in this paper to account for situations where the gravitational constant varies. Based on this equation, we find that the amplitude of gravitational waves will be corrected. Consequently the estimated distance to the gravitational wave source without considering such a correction may be biased. Applying our correction result to the well known binary neutron star coalescence event GW170817, we get a constraint on the variation of the gravitational constant. Relating our result to the Yukawa deviation of gravity, we for the first time get the constraint of the Yukawa parameters in 10Mpc scale.

    "summary": "High-frequency gravitational waves are crucial for understanding the very early universe and distinguishing between various cosmological models, but detecting them remains a significant challenge. We investigated the effects of high-frequency gravitational waves on photonic-like electronic transport in graphene. The results show that, unlike the influence of gravitational waves on the propagation of light, the influence of gravitational waves on photonic-like electronic transport can accumulate not only in real space but also in $k$-space. This makes photonic-like electronic transport under gravitational waves similar to the propagation of light in a medium where the refractive index varies dramatically due to gravitational waves, and with shorter wavelengths. As a result, the relative intensity variation in photonic-like electronic transport under gravitational waves exceeds that of a laser interferometer with the same arm length by six orders of magnitude. At low temperatures, the influence of phonons on photon-like transport in the context of high-frequency gravitational waves can be ignored. These findings indicate a strong interaction between gravitational waves and electron transport, which helps to deepen the understanding of the interaction between gravitational waves and matter, and provides a different method for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves.",

Starting with simple case of an electromagnetic wave travelling in the field of a plane monochromatic gravitational wave we introduce the concept of surfing effect and analyze its physical consequences. We then generalize these results to an arbitrary gravitational wave field. We show that, due to the transverse nature of gravitational waves, the surfing effect leads to significant observable consequences only if the velocity of gravitational waves deviates from speed of light. This fact can help to place an upper limit on the deviation of gravitational wave velocity from speed of light. The micro-arcsecond resolution promised by the upcoming precision interferometry experiments allow to place stringent upper limits on $\\epsilon = (v_{gw}-c)/c$ as a function of the energy density parameter for gravitational waves $\\Omega_{gw}$. For $\\Omega_{gw} \\approx 10^{-10}$ this limit amounts to $\\epsilon\\lesssim 2\\cdot 10^{-2}$.",

A simple method for constraining the graviton mass is to compare the arrival time of light and that of gravitational waves provided that both waves are simultaneously emitted from the same source. To date, from observations of gravitational waves by the LIGO, the upper bound on the graviton mass $m_g$ is given by $m_g\\lesssim 5.0 \\times 10^{-23}$eV. However, when we compare the arrival time of light and gravitational waves, lensing effects could be important for some cases. Moreover, in many cases, the wavelength of gravitational waves is comparable with the gravitational radius of a lens object. Hence, we calculate arrival time differences between electromagnetic waves and massive gravitational waves by taking into account the effect of the gravitational wave optics. Here we take two lens models, a point mass lens and a singular isothermal sphere lens. We find that the lensing changes the arrival time difference of two waves by more than a second for the massive gravitational waves detectable by the LISA.",

The resulting solution describes the interaction of a scalar plane wave travelling in an arbitrary direction relative to the direction of propagation of the gravitational wave. This solution has the unexpected property that as the scalar wave approaches collinearity with the gravitational wave there is a rapid transition in the form of the solution. The solution in the collinear limit exhibits a resonance phenomenon which distinguishes these results from previous analyses involving plane gravitational wave backgrounds. We discuss in detail the similarities and differences between the solutions for plane gravitational waves and gravitational waves with amplitude that decreases with distance from the source. We give an argument that this solution of the Klein-Gordon equation only describes the interaction of a gravitational wave with a scalar wave and that the gravitational wave will not produce a scalar waveform in a vacuum. The interaction between the gravitational and scalar waves lead to both sinusoidal time-dependent fluctuations in, and time-independent enhancement of, the scalar current in the direction of the gravitational wave. Finally, we discuss the possibility of observable effects of this interaction.",

Primordial gravitational waves were generated in the early universe and thus it is important to study interaction of the gravitational waves in cosmological backgrounds. In this paper we discuss the interaction of electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves in a de-Sitter background. We find that the electromagnetic wave is perturbed and modulated.

    "summary": "Based on the freely-falling Unruh-Dewitt model, we study the influence of gravitational waves on the quantum multibody states, i.e. the twin-Fock (TF) state and the mixture of Dicke states. The amount of entanglement of quantum many-body states decreases first and then increases with increasing frequency of gravitational waves. In particular, for some fixed frequencies of gravitational waves, entanglement will increase with the increasing amplitude of gravitational waves, which is different from the usual thought of gravity-induced decoherence and could provide a novel understanding for the quantum property of gravitational waves.",

The background evolution of gravitational waves in a flat FRW universe is considered and studied in the presence of various holographic dark energy models.

These solutions are studied in detail to get a proper understanding of the characteristics of the gravitational waves in the presence of holographic dark energy. The work can be a significant tool in studying different dark energy models comparatively using the features of the gravitational wave evolution.",

Strong gravitational waves will come from some drastic astronomical objects, e.g. coalescence of neutron star binaries, black holes, supernovae, rotating pulsars and pulsar glitches. Detection of the gravitational waves from these objects will open a new door of \\textit{`gravitational wave astronomy'}. Gravitational wave will be a probe to study the physics and astrophysics. To search these gravitational waves, large-scale laser interferometers will compose a global network of detectors. Advanced LIGO and advanced Virgo are upgrading from currents detectors. One of LIGO detector is considering to move Australia Site. IndIGO or Einstein Telescope are future plans. LCGT (Large-scale Cryogenic Gravitational wave Telescope) is now constructing in Japan with distinctive characters: cryogenic cooling mirror and underground site. We will present a design and a construction status of LCGT, and brief status of current gravitational wave detectors in the world. Network of these gravitational wave detectors will start in late 2016 or 2017, and may discover the gravitational waves. For example, these detectors will reach its search range for coalescence of neutron star binary is over 200 Mpc, and several or more events per year will be expected. Since most of gravitational wave events are from high-energy phenomenon of the astronomical objects, these might have counterpart evidences in electromagnetic radiation (visible light, X/gamma ray), neutrino, high energy particles or others. Thus, the mutual follow-up observations will give us more information of these objects.",

    "summary": "Space-based gravitational wave detection is based on the astrodynamical equations derived from gravitational theory to detect changes in distance between spacecraft/celestial bodies and/or their state changes caused by gravitational waves. The fundamental method involves using electromagnetic waves (including radio waves, microwaves, light waves, X-rays, gamma rays, etc.) for Doppler tracking and comparing to the stable frequency standards (sources) at both the transmitting and receiving ends. Examples include microwave Doppler tracking, optical clock gravitational wave detection, atom interferometry gravitational wave detection, and laser interferometry gravitational wave detection. If the frequency sources at both ends are not sufficiently stable, a generalized dual-path Michelson interferometer based on Doppler tracking combinations is needed. Currently, the main space-based gravitational wave detectors under construction or planning are laser interferometers, which cover medium frequency (0.1-10 Hz) and low-frequency (millihertz 0.1-100 mHz and microhertz 0.1-100 {\\mu}Hz) gravitational wave detection bands.

The initial detectors have reached their design sensitivities and now the effort is on to construct advanced detectors which are expected to detect gravitational waves from astrophysical sources.

The studies on gravitational waves induced by primordial curvature perturbations are of great interest. The aim of this paper is to investigate the third order induced gravitational waves. Based on the theory of cosmological perturbations, the first order scalar induces the second order scalar, vector and tensor perturbations. At the next iteration, the first order scalar, the second order scalar, vector and tensor perturbations all induce the third order tensor perturbations. We present the energy density spectrum of the third order gravitational waves for a monochromatic primordial power spectrum. The shape of the energy density spectrum of the third order gravitational waves is different from that of the second order scalar induced gravitational waves. And it is found that the third order gravitational waves sourced by the second order scalar perturbations dominate the energy density spectrum.",

    "title": "Does gravitational wave assist vacuum steering and Bell nonlocality?",
    "summary": "We study quantum steering and Bell nonlocality harvested by the local interaction of two Unruh-DeWitt detectors with the vacuum massless scalar field, both in the presence of gravitational waves and in Minkowski spacetime. It is shown that quantum steerability under the influence of gravitational waves can be greater than or less than quantum steerability in Minkowski spacetime, which means that the gravitational waves can amplify or degrade the harvested steering. In particular, a resonance effect occurs when the energy gap of the detector is tuned to the frequency of the gravitational wave. We also find that the harvesting-achievable separation range of vacuum steering can be expanded or reduced by the presence of gravitational waves, which depends on the energy gap, the gravitational wave frequency, and the duration of the gravitational wave action. It is interesting to note that two detector systems that satisfy the Bell inequality in most parameter spaces, regardless of the existence of gravitational waves, indicating that steering harvesting cannot be considered to be nonlocal.",

    "summary": "Recently there are more and more interest on the gravitational wave of moving sources. This introduces a Lorentz transformation problem of gravitational wave. Although Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) theory has in principle already included the Lorentz transformation of gravitational wave, the transformation of the three dimensional gravitational wave tensor has not been explicitly calculated before. Within four dimensional spacetime, gravitational wave have property of `boost weight zero' and `spin weight 2'. This fact makes the Lorentz transformation of gravitational wave difficult to understand. In the current paper we adopt the traditional three dimensional tensor description of gravitational wave. Such a transverse-traceless tensor describes the gravitational wave freedom directly. We derive the explicit Lorentz transformation of the gravitational wave tensor. The transformation is similar to the Lorentz transformation for electric field vector and magnetic field vector which are three dimensional vectors. Based on the deduced Lorentz transformation of the gravitational wave three dimensional tensor, we can construct the gravitational waveform of moving source with any speed if only the waveform of the corresponding rest waveform is given. As an example, we apply our method to the effect of kick velocity of binary black hole. The adjusted waveform by the kick velocity is presented.",

    "summary": "Einstein's general relativity predicts that pressure, in general stresses, play a similar role to energy density in generating gravity. The source of gravitational field, the active gravitational mass density, sometimes referred to as Whittaker's mass density, is not conserved, hence its changes can propagate as monopole gravitational waves. Such waves can be generated only by astrophysical sources with varying gravitational mass. Here we show that relativistic fireballs, considered in modelling gamma-ray burst phenomena, are likely to radiate monopole gravitational waves from high-pressure plasma with varying Whittaker's mass. Also, ejection of a significant amount of initial mass-energy of the progenitor contributes to the monopole gravitational radiation. We identify monopole waves with h^11+h^22 waves of Eddington's classification which propagate (in the z-direction) together with the energy carried by massless fields. We show that the monopole waves satisfy Einstein's equations, with a common stress-energy tensor for massless fields. The polarization mode of monopole waves is Phi_22, i.e. these are perpendicular waves which induce changes of the radius of a circle of test particles only (breathing mode). The astrophysical importance of monopole gravitational waves is discussed.",

    "summary": "The existence of large--scale magnetic fields in the universe has led to the observation that if gravitational waves propagating in a cosmological environment encounter even a small magnetic field then electromagnetic radiation is produced. To study this phenomenon in more detail we take it out of the cosmological context and at the same time simplify the gravitational radiation to impulsive waves. Specifically, to illustrate our findings, we describe the following three physical situations: (1) a cylindrical impulsive gravitational wave propagating into a universe with a magnetic field, (2) an axially symmetric impulsive gravitational wave propagating into a universe with an electric field and (3) a `spherical' impulsive gravitational wave propagating into a universe with a small magnetic field. In cases (1) and (3) electromagnetic radiation is produced behind the gravitational wave. In case (2) no electromagnetic radiation appears after the wave unless a current is established behind the wave breaking the Maxwell vacuum. In all three cases the presence of the magnetic or electric fields results in a modification of the amplitude of the incoming gravitational wave which is explicitly calculated using the Einstein--Maxwell vacuum field equations.",

    "summary": "We present a novel principle for quantum sensing of gravitational waves by exploiting the collective emission rate of a one-dimensional array of initially uncorrelated atoms to selectively amplify a gravitational wave signal over flat spacetime contributions. In contrast to a single atom, we find that the collective emission rate of the array is sensitive to the gravitational wave at first order in its amplitude. We quantify the collective response of the array to an incident gravitational wave by introducing the notion of the effective number of atoms cooperating to sense the gravitational wave. We determine the optimal interatomic spacing such that the flat spacetime collective effects vanish, but the imprint of the gravitational wave in the emission rate of the array scales nearly quadratically with the number of atoms. The near-quadratic scaling counteracts the small amplitude of the gravitational wave. Furthermore, the coherent photon emission, which encodes the gravitational wave imprint, exhibits well-defined directionality and occurs at frequencies shifted by the wave's frequency. We analyze the setup's response to prototypical gravitational wave signals and show that, for coherent array sizes potentially realizable in the near-term, the two advancements - collective response at first order in the gravitational wave's amplitude, and near-quadratic scaling with the number of atoms - yield a photon emission rate large enough to be resolved by current technology in photon detectors.",

For the most simple case of a gravitational wave background arising during a period of inflation, the effect results to be three to four orders of magnitude smaller than its scalar counterpart, and is thus undetectable.

Short duration bursts of gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae or mergers of binary black holes may bring a wealth of astronomical and astrophysical information. The weakness of the waves and the rarity of the events urges the development of optimal methods to detect the waves. The waves from these sources are not generally known well enough to use matched filtering however; this drives the need to develop new ways to exploit source simulation information in both detections and information extraction. We present an algorithmic approach to using catalogs of gravitational-wave signals developed through numerical simulation, or otherwise, to enhance our ability to detect these waves. As more detailed simulations become available, it is straightforward to incorporate the new information into the search method. This approach may also be useful when trying to extract information from a gravitational-wave observation by allowing direct comparison between the observation and simulations.",

    "summary": "A valuable target for advanced gravitational-wave detectors is the stochastic gravitational-wave background. The stochastic background imparts a weak correlated signal into networks of gravitational-wave detectors, and so standard searches for the gravitational-wave background rely on measuring cross-correlations between pairs of widely-separated detectors. Stochastic searches, however, can be affected by any other correlated effects which may also be present, including correlated frequency combs and magnetic Schumann resonances. As stochastic searches become sensitive to ever-weaker signals, it is increasingly important to develop methods to separate a true astrophysical signal from other spurious and/or terrestrial signals. Here, we describe a novel method to achieve this goal -- gravitational-wave geodesy. Just as radio geodesy allows for the localization of radio telescopes, so too can observations of the gravitational-wave background be used to infer the positions and orientations of gravitational-wave detectors. By demanding that a true observation of the gravitational-wave background yield constraints consistent with the baseline's known geometry, we demonstrate that we can successfully validate true observations of the gravitational-wave background while rejecting spurious signals due to correlated terrestrial effects.",

    "summary": "Gravitational wave memory is an important prediction of general relativity. The detection of the gravitational wave memory can be used to test general relativity and to deduce the property of the gravitational wave source. Quantitative model is important for such detection and signal interpretation. Previous works on gravitational wave memory always use the energy flux of gravitational wave to calculate memory. Such relation between gravitational wave energy and memory has only been validated for post-Newtonian approximation. The result of numerical relativity about gravitational wave memory is not confident yet. Accurately calculating memory is highly demanded. Here we propose a new method to calculate the gravitational wave memory. This method is based on Bondi-Metzner-Sachs theory. Consequently our method does not need slow motion and weak field conditions for gravitational wave source. Our new method can accurately calculate memory if the non-memory waveform is known. As an example, we combine our method with matured numerical relativity result about non-memory waveform for binary black hole coalescence. We calculate the waveform for memory which can be used to aid memory detection and gravitational wave source understanding. Our calculation result confirms preliminary numerical relativity result about memory. We find out the dependence of the memory amplitude to the mass ratio and the spins of the two spin aligned black holes.",

    "summary": "In this work, we consider a general gravitational wave detector of gravitational wave interacting with an incoming gravitational wave carrying plus polarization only placed inside a harmonic trap. This model can be well acquainted with the description of a resonant detector of gravitational wave as well. The well known detector-gravitational wave interaction scenario uses the method of a semi classical approach where the detector is treated quantum mechanically but the gravitational wave is considered at a classical level. In our analysis, we use a discrete mode decomposition of the gravitational wave perturbation which results in a Hamiltonian involving the position and momentum operators corresponding to the gravitational wave and the harmonic oscillator. We have then calculated the transition probability for the harmonic oscillator-gravitational wave tensor product state for going from an initial state to some unknown final state. Using the energy flux relation of the gravitational waves, we observe that if we consider the total energy as a combination of the number of gravitons in the initial state of the detector then the transition probability for the resonant absorption case scenario takes the analytical form which is exactly similar to the semi-classical absorption case. In case of the emission scenario, we observe a spontaneous emission of a single graviton which was completely absent in the semi-classical analouge of this model. This therefore gives a direct signature of linearized quantum gravity.",

A continuous wave search algorithm, Fscan, and the calculation of the coherence between the gravitational wave channels and auxiliary channels has been developed to identify the source of noise lines. The programs analyze data from the gravitational wave channels as well as environmental sensors, searching for significant lines that appear in coincidence (using various thresholds and frequency windows) in the gravitational wave channel as well the environmental monitors. By this method, the source of powerful signals at specific frequencies in the gravitational wave channel caused by noise can be determined.

A simple interpretation of the results is that a gravitational wave causes a phase modulation of electromagnetic waves. We arrive at this picture from two contrasting directions, namely null geodesics and Maxwell's equations, or, geometric and wave optics. Under geometric optics, we express the geodesic equations in Hamiltonian form and solve perturbatively for the effect of gravitational waves. We find that the well-known time-delay formula for light generalizes trivially to massive particles. We also recover, by way of a Hamilton-Jacobi equation, the phase modulation obtained under wave optics. Turning then to wave optics - rather than solving Maxwell's equations directly for the fields, as in most previous approaches - we derive a perturbed wave equation (perturbed by the gravitational wave) for the electromagnetic four-potential. From this wave equation it follows that the four-potential and the electric and magnetic fields all experience the same phase modulation. Applying such a phase modulation to a superposition of plane waves corresponding to a Gaussian wave packet leads to time delays.",

    "title": "Listening to the Universe with Gravitational-Wave Astronomy",
    "summary": "The LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) detectors have just completed their first science run, following many years of planning, research, and development. LIGO is a member of what will be a worldwide network of gravitational-wave observatories, with other members in Europe, Japan, and -- hopefully -- Australia. Plans are rapidly maturing for a low frequency, space-based gravitational-wave observatory: LISA, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, to be launched around 2011. The goal of these instruments is to inaugurate the field of {\\it gravitational-wave astronomy}: using gravitational-waves as a means of listening to highly relativistic dynamical processes in astrophysics. This review discusses the promise of this field, outlining why gravitational waves are worth pursuing, and what they are uniquely suited to teach us about astrophysical phenomena. We review the current state of the field, both theoretical and experimental, and then highlight some aspects of gravitational-wave science that are particularly exciting (at least to this author).",
