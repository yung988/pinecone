    "summary": "Quantum computation and quantum information are of great current interest in computer science, mathematics, physical sciences and engineering. They will likely lead to a new wave of technological innovations in communication, computation and cryptography. As the theory of quantum physics is fundamentally stochastic, randomness and uncertainty are deeply rooted in quantum computation, quantum simulation and quantum information. Consequently quantum algorithms are random in nature, and quantum simulation utilizes Monte Carlo techniques extensively. Thus statistics can play an important role in quantum computation and quantum simulation, which in turn offer great potential to revolutionize computational statistics. While only pseudo-random numbers can be generated by classical computers, quantum computers are able to produce genuine random numbers; quantum computers can exponentially or quadratically speed up median evaluation, Monte Carlo integration and Markov chain simulation. This paper gives a brief review on quantum computation, quantum simulation and quantum information. We introduce the basic concepts of quantum computation and quantum simulation and present quantum algorithms that are known to be much faster than the available classic algorithms. We provide a statistical framework for the analysis of quantum algorithms and quantum simulation.",

    "summary": "With the advent of interconnected quantum computers, i.e., distributed quantum computing (DQC), multiple quantum computers can now collaborate via quantum networks to perform massively complex computational tasks. However, DQC faces problems sharing quantum information because it cannot be cloned or duplicated between quantum computers. Thanks to advanced quantum mechanics, quantum computers can teleport quantum information across quantum networks. However, challenges to utilizing efficiently quantum resources, e.g., quantum computers and quantum channels, arise in DQC due to their capabilities and properties, such as uncertain qubit fidelity and quantum channel noise. In this paper, we propose a resource allocation scheme for DQC based on stochastic programming to minimize the total deployment cost for quantum resources. Essentially, the two-stage stochastic programming model is formulated to handle the uncertainty of quantum computing demands, computing power, and fidelity in quantum networks. The performance evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and ability of the proposed scheme to balance the utilization of quantum computers and on-demand quantum computers while minimizing the overall cost of provisioning under uncertainty.",

The computational complexity and the time taken both increase rapidly with the number of investments in the portfolio. It becomes difficult, even impossible for classic computers to solve. Quantum computing is a new way of computing which takes advantage of quantum superposition and entanglement. It changes how such problems are approached and is not constrained by some of the classic computational complexity. Studies have shown that quantum computing can offer significant advantages over classical computing in many fields. The application of quantum computing has been constrained by the unavailability of actual quantum computers. In the past decade, there has been the rapid development of the large-scale quantum computer. However, software development for quantum computing is slow in many fields. In our study, we apply quantum computing to a multi-asset portfolio simulation. The simulation is based on historic data, covariance, and expected returns, all calculated using quantum computing. Although technically a solvable problem for classical computing, we believe the software development is important to the future application of quantum computing in finance.

However, the computational power of the current quantum computers, referred to as Noisy Internediate Scale Quantum, or NISQ, is severely limited because of environmental and intrinsic noise, as well as the very low connectivity between qubits compared to their total amount. We propose a virtual quantum processor that emulates a generic hybrid quantum machine which can serve as a logical version of quantum computing hardware. This hybrid classical quantum machine powers quantum-logical computations which are substitutable by future native quantum processors.",

    "summary": "Photonic quantum computation refers to quantum computation that uses photons as the physical system for doing the quantum computation. Photons are ideal quantum systems because they operate at room temperature, and photonic technologies are relatively mature. The field is largely divided between discrete- and continuous-variable photonic quantum computation. In discrete-variable (DV) photonic quantum computation, quantum information is represented by one or more modal properties (e.g. polarization) that take on distinct values from a finite set. Quantum information is processed via operations on these modal properties and eventually measured using single photon detectors. In continuous-variable (CV) photonic quantum computation, quantum information is represented by properties of the electromagnetic field that take on any value in an interval (e.g. position). The electromagnetic field is transformed via Gaussian and non-Gaussian operations, and then detected via homodyne detection. Both CV and DV photonic quantum computation have been realized experimentally and they each have a unique set of challenges that need to be overcome to achieve scalable photonic universal quantum computation. This article is an introduction to photonic quantum computing, charting its development from the early days of linear optical quantum computing to recent developments in quantum machine learning.",

These criteria were formulated specifically for the circuit model of quantum computing. However, several new models for quantum computing (paradigms) have been proposed that do not seem to fit the criteria well. The question is therefore what are the general criteria for implementing quantum computers. To this end, a formal operational definition of a quantum computer is introduced. It is then shown that according to this definition a device is a quantum computer if it obeys the following four criteria: Any quantum computer must (1) have a quantum memory; (2) facilitate a controlled quantum evolution of the quantum memory; (3) include a method for cooling the quantum memory; and (4) provide a readout mechanism for subsets of the quantum memory. The criteria are met when the device is scalable and operates fault-tolerantly. We discuss various existing quantum computing paradigms, and how they fit within this framework. Finally, we lay out a roadmap for selecting an avenue towards building a quantum computer. This is summarized in a decision tree intended to help experimentalists determine the most natural paradigm given a particular physical implementation.",

    "summary": "The advancement of quantum computing technology has led to the emergence of early-stage quantum cloud computing services. To fully realize the potential of quantum cloud computing, it is essential to develop techniques that ensure the privacy of both data and functions. Quantum computations often leverage superposition to evaluate a function on all possible inputs simultaneously, making function privacy a critical requirement. In 2009, Broadbent et al. introduced the Universal Blind Quantum Computation (UBQC) protocol, which is based on Measurement-Based Quantum Computation (MBQC) and provides a framework for ensuring both function and data privacy in quantum computing. Although theoretical results indicate an equivalence between MBQC and circuitbased quantum computation, translating MBQC into circuitbased implementations remains challenging due to higher qubit requirements and the complexity of the transformation process. Consequently, current quantum cloud computing platforms are limited in their ability to simulate MBQC efficiently. This paper presents an efficient method to simulate MBQC on circuit-based quantum computing platforms. We validate this approach by implementing the two-qubit Grover algorithm in the MBQC framework and further demonstrate blindness by applying the UBQC protocol. This work verifies the simulation of a blind quantum computation using the two-qubit Grover algorithm on a circuit-based quantum computing platform.",

The fundamental atoms processed by quantum computation are the quantum bits which are dealt with in quantum information theory. The theory of quantum computation will be based upon a model of universal quantum computer whose elementary unit is a two-port interferometer capable of arbitrary $U(2)$ transformations. Basic to all these considerations is quantum theory, in particular Hilbert space quantum mechanics.",

    "summary": "The standard generic quantum computer model is studied analytically and numerically and the border for emergence of quantum chaos, induced by imperfections and residual inter-qubit couplings, is determined. This phenomenon appears in an isolated quantum computer without any external decoherence. The onset of quantum chaos leads to quantum computer hardware melting, strong quantum entropy growth and destruction of computer operability. The time scales for development of quantum chaos and ergodicity are determined. In spite the fact that this phenomenon is rather dangerous for quantum computing it is shown that the quantum chaos border for inter-qubit coupling is exponentially larger than the energy level spacing between quantum computer eigenstates and drops only linearly with the number of qubits n. As a result the ideal multi-qubit structure of the computer remains rather robust against imperfections. This opens a broad parameter region for a possible realization of quantum computer. The obtained results are related to the recent studies of quantum chaos in such many-body systems as nuclei, complex atoms and molecules, finite Fermi systems and quantum spin glass shards which are also reviewed in the paper.",

    "summary": "Classical random walk formalism shows a significant role across a wide range of applications. As its quantum counterpart, the quantum walk is proposed as an important theoretical model for quantum computing. By exploiting the quantum effects such as superposition, interference and entanglement, quantum walks and their variety have been extensively studied for achieving beyond classical computing power, and they have been broadly used in designing quantum algorithms in fields ranging from algebraic and optimization problems, graph and network analysis, to quantum Hamiltonian and biochemical process simulations, and even further quantum walk models have proven their capabilities for universal quantum computation. Compared to the conventional quantum circuit models, quantum walks show a feasible path for implementing application-specific quantum computing in particularly the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. Recently remarkable progress has been achieved in implementing a wide variety of quantum walks and quantum walk applications, demonstrating the great potential of quantum walks. In this review, we provide a thorough summary of quantum walks and quantum walk computing, including aspects of quantum walk theories and characteristics, advances in their physical implementations and the flourishingly developed quantum walk computing applications. We also discuss the challenges facing quantum walk computing, toward realizing a practical quantum computer in the near future.",

However, due to the uncertain qubit fidelity and quantum channel noise, distributed quantum computing which relies on quantum networks connected through entanglement faces a lot of challenges for exchanging information across quantum computers. In this paper, we propose an adaptive distributed quantum computing approach to manage quantum computers and quantum channels for solving optimization tasks in future networks. Firstly, we describe the fundamentals of quantum computing and its distributed concept in quantum networks. Secondly, to address the uncertainty of future demands of collaborative optimization tasks and instability over quantum networks, we propose a quantum resource allocation scheme based on stochastic programming for minimizing quantum resource consumption. Finally, based on the proposed approach, we discuss the potential applications for collaborative optimization in future networks, such as smart grid management, IoT cooperation, and UAV trajectory planning. Promising research directions that can lead to the design and implementation of future distributed quantum computing frameworks are also highlighted.",

    "summary": "A quantum computer is a hypothetical device in which the laws of quantum mechanics are used to introduce a degree of parallelism into computations and which could therefore significantly improve on the computational speed of a classical computer at certain tasks. Cluster state quantum computing (recently proposed by Raussendorf and Briegel) is a new paradigm in quantum information processing and is a departure from the conventional model of quantum computation. The cluster state quantum computer begins by creating a highly entangled multi-particle state (the cluster state) which it uses as a quantum resource during the computation. Information is processed in the computer via selected measurements on individual qubits that form the cluster state. We describe in detail how a scalable quantum computer can be constructed using microwave cavity QED and, in a departure from the traditional understanding of a computer as a fixed array of computational elements, we show that cluster state quantum computing is well suited to atomic beam experiments. We show that all of the necessary elements have been individually realised, and that the construction of a truly scalable atomic beam quantum computer may be an experimental reality in the near future.",

Two models for performing measurement-based quantum computation exist: the one-way quantum computer was introduced by Briegel and Raussendorf, and quantum computation via projective measurements only by Nielsen. The more recent development of this second model is based on state transfers instead of teleportation. From this development, a finite but approximate quantum universal family of observables is exhibited, which includes only one two-qubit observable, while others are one-qubit observables. In this article, an infinite but exact quantum universal family of observables is proposed, including also only one two-qubit observable.   The rest of the paper is dedicated to compare these two models of measurement-based quantum computation, i.e. one-way quantum computation and quantum computation via projective measurements only. From this comparison, which was initiated by Cirac and Verstraete, closer and more natural connections appear between these two models. These close connections lead to a unified view of measurement-based quantum computation.",

The client's privacy is protected (blindness) and the correctness of the computation is verifiable by the client in spite of her limited quantum technology (verifiability). There are mainly two types of protocols for verifiable blind quantum computing: the protocol where the client has only to generate single-qubit states, and the protocol where the client needs only the ability of single-qubit measurements. The latter is called the measurement-only verifiable blind quantum computing. If the input of the client's quantum computing is a quantum state whose classical efficient description is not known to the client, there was no way for the measurement-only client to verify the correctness of the input. Here we introduce a new protocol of measurement-only verifiable blind quantum computing where the correctness of the quantum input is also verifiable.",

Unlike quantum computing, which consists of a sequence of unitary transformations (gates) and projectors (measurements), symplectic computation involves a sequence of symplectic transformations and measurements.   The proposal to explore symplectic computers is based on the following quantum-symplectic duality. The Schr\\\"odinger equation in its standard complex form describes the unitary evolution of a quantum system, while its real form describes the symplectic evolution of a classical mechanical system. This quantum-symplectic duality can be leveraged to enhance the capabilities of quantum and symplectic computers. In this symplectic approach, the role of a quantum bit (qubit) is taken by a symplectic bit (symbit).",

Topological quantum computers use particles with exotic exchange statistics called non-Abelian anyons, and the simplest anyon model which allows for universal quantum computation by particle exchange or braiding alone is the Fibonacci anyon model. One classically hard problem that can be solved efficiently using quantum computation is finding the value of the Jones polynomial of knots at roots of unity. We aim to provide a pedagogical, self-contained, review of topological quantum computation with Fibonacci anyons, from the braiding statistics and matrices to the layout of such a computer and the compiling of braids to perform specific operations. Then we use a simulation of a topological quantum computer to explicitly demonstrate a quantum computation using Fibonacci anyons, evaluating the Jones polynomial of a selection of simple knots. In addition to simulating a modular circuit-style quantum algorithm, we also show how the magnitude of the Jones polynomial at specific points could be obtained exactly using Fibonacci or Ising anyons. Such an exact algorithm seems ideally suited for a proof of concept demonstration of a topological quantum computer.",

    "title": "A Practitioner's Guide to Quantum Algorithms for Optimisation Problems",
    "summary": "Quantum computing is gaining popularity across a wide range of scientific disciplines due to its potential to solve long-standing computational problems that are considered intractable with classical computers. One promising area where quantum computing has potential is in the speed-up of NP-hard optimisation problems that are common in industrial areas such as logistics and finance. Newcomers to the field of quantum computing who are interested in using this technology to solve optimisation problems do not have an easily accessible source of information on the current capabilities of quantum computers and algorithms. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the theory of quantum optimisation techniques and their practical application, focusing on their near-term potential for noisy intermediate scale quantum devices. Two main paradigms for quantum hardware are then discussed: quantum annealing and gate-based quantum computing. While quantum annealers are effective for some optimisation problems, they have limitations and cannot be used for universal quantum computation. In contrast, gate-based quantum computers offer the potential for universal quantum computation, but they face challenges with hardware limitations and accurate gate implementation. The paper provides a detailed mathematical discussion with references to key works in the field, as well as a more practical discussion with relevant examples. The most popular techniques for quantum optimisation on gate-based quantum computers, the quantum approximate optimisation (QAO) algorithm and the quantum alternating operator ansatz (QAOA) framework, are discussed in detail. The paper concludes with a discussion of the challenges facing quantum optimisation techniques and the need for further research and development to identify new, effective methods for achieving quantum advantage.",

    "summary": "Quantum computation is a promising emerging technology, and by utilizing the principles of quantum mechanics, it is expected to achieve faster computations than classical computers for specific problems. There are two distinct architectures for quantum computation: gate-based quantum computers and quantum annealing. In gate-based quantum computation, we implement a sequence of quantum gates that manipulate qubits. This approach allows us to perform universal quantum computation, yet they pose significant experimental challenges for large-scale integration. On the other hand, with quantum annealing, the solution of the optimization problem can be obtained by preparing the ground state. Conventional quantum annealing devices with transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian, such as those manufactured by D-Wave Inc., achieving around 5000 qubits, are relatively more amenable to large-scale integration but are limited to specific computations. In this paper, we present a practical method for implementing universal quantum computation within the conventional quantum annealing architecture using the transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian. Our innovative approach relies on an adiabatic transformation of the Hamiltonian, changing from transverse fields to a ferromagnetic interaction regime, where the ground states become degenerate. Notably, our proposal is compatible with D-Wave devices, opening up possibilities for realizing large-scale gate-based quantum computers. This research bridges the gap between conventional quantum annealing and gate-based quantum computation, offering a promising path toward the development of scalable quantum computing platforms.",

Analogous to classical computer networks, quantum networks allow for the distribution of quantum computation among quantum computers. In this work, we describe a quantum walk protocol to perform distributed quantum computing in a quantum network. The protocol uses a quantum walk as a quantum control signal to perform distributed quantum operations. We consider a generalization of the discrete-time coined quantum walk model that accounts for the interaction between a quantum walker system in the network graph with quantum registers inside the network nodes. The protocol logically captures distributed quantum computing, abstracting hardware implementation and the transmission of quantum information through channels. Control signal transmission is mapped to the propagation of the walker system across the network, while interactions between the control layer and the quantum registers are embedded into the application of coin operators. We demonstrate how to use the quantum walker system to perform a distributed CNOT operation, which shows the universality of the protocol for distributed quantum computing. Furthermore, we apply the protocol to the task of entanglement distribution in a quantum network.",

    "summary": "Quantum computers are expected to offer substantial speedups over their classical counterparts and to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers. Beyond such practical significance, the concept of quantum computation opens up new fundamental questions, among them the issue whether or not quantum computations can be certified by entities that are inherently unable to compute the results themselves. Here we present the first experimental verification of quantum computations. We show, in theory and in experiment, how a verifier with minimal quantum resources can test a significantly more powerful quantum computer. The new verification protocol introduced in this work utilizes the framework of blind quantum computing and is independent of the experimental quantum-computation platform used. In our scheme, the verifier is only required to generate single qubits and transmit them to the quantum computer. We experimentally demonstrate this protocol using four photonic qubits and show how the verifier can test the computer's ability to perform measurement-based quantum computations.",

    "summary": "It is shown in the paper that the unitary quantum dynamics in quantum mechanics is the universal quantum driving force to speed up a quantum computation. This assertion supports strongly in theory that the unitary quantum dynamics is the fundamental and universal principle in nature. On the other hand, the symmetric structure of Hilbert space of a composite quantum system is the quantum-computing resource that is not owned by classical computation. A new quantum-computing speedup theory is set up on the basis of the unitary quantum dynamics. Both the unitary quantum dynamics and the symmetric structure and property of the Hilbert space of the quantum system are mainly responsible for an exponential quantum-computing speedup for a general efficient quantum algorithm. The inherent importance for the unitary quantum dynamics to speed up a quantum computation lies in the unique ability of the unitary quantum dynamics to build the effective interaction between the symmetric structure of the Hilbert space of the quantum system and the mathematical symmetric structure of a problem to be solved on the quantum system. This unique ability could result in an essential difference of computational power between quantum and classical computations by combining the symmetric structure and property of the Hilbert space. The new quantum-computing speedup theory also provides reasonable mechanisms for exponential quantum-computing speedup for the existing efficient quantum algorithms based on the quantum parallel principle. These existing quantum algorithms including the hidden-subgroup-problem quantum algorithms and conventional quantum search algorithms have the common character that the symmetric structure of the Hilbert space does not have any effective effect on these quantum algorithms. This could be the main reason why these quantum algorithms are quite special and considered to be semiclassical.",

However, current technology is still too noisy and imperfect to construct a universal digital quantum computer with quantum error correction. Inspired by the evolution of classical computation, an alternative paradigm merging the flexibility of digital quantum computation with the robustness of analog quantum simulation has emerged. This universal paradigm is known as digital-analog quantum computing. Here, we introduce an efficient digital-analog quantum algorithm to compute the quantum Fourier transform, a subroutine widely employed in several relevant quantum algorithms. We show that, under reasonable assumptions about noise models, the fidelity of the quantum Fourier transformation improves considerably using this approach when the number of qubits involved grows. This suggests that, in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, hybrid protocols combining digital and analog quantum computing could be a sensible approach to reach useful quantum supremacy.",

    "summary": "Quantum computer possesses quantum parallelism and offers great computing power over classical computer \\cite{er1,er2}. As is well-know, a moving quantum object passing through a double-slit exhibits particle wave duality. A quantum computer is static and lacks this duality property. The recently proposed duality computer has exploited this particle wave duality property, and it may offer additional computing power \\cite{r1}. Simply put it, a duality computer is a moving quantum computer passing through a double-slit. A duality computer offers the capability to perform separate operations on the sub-waves coming out of the different slits, in the so-called duality parallelism. Here we show that an $n$-dubit duality computer can be modeled by an $(n+1)$-qubit quantum computer. In a duality mode, computing operations are not necessarily unitary. A $n$-qubit quantum computer can be used as an $n$-bit reversible classical computer and is energy efficient. Our result further enables a $(n+1)$-qubit quantum computer to run classical algorithms in a $O(2^n)$-bit classical computer. The duality mode provides a natural link between classical computing and quantum computing. Here we also propose a recycling computing mode in which a quantum computer will continue to compute until the result is obtained. These two modes provide new tool for algorithm design.

    "summary": "Gate-model quantum computers provide an experimentally implementable architecture for near term quantum computations. To design a reduced quantum circuit that can simulate a high complexity reference quantum circuit, an optimization should be taken on the number of input quantum states, on the unitary operations of the quantum circuit, and on the number of output measurement rounds. Besides the optimization of the physical layout of the hardware layer, the quantum computer should also solve difficult computational problems very efficiently. To yield a desired output system, a particular objective function associated with the computational problem fed into the quantum computer should be maximized. The reduced gate structure should be able to produce the maximized value of the objective function. These parallel requirements must be satisfied simultaneously, which makes the optimization difficult. Here, we demonstrate a method for designing quantum circuits for gate-model quantum computers and define the Quantum Triple Annealing Minimization (QTAM) algorithm. The aim of QTAM is to determine an optimal reduced topology for the quantum circuits in the hardware layer at the maximization of the objective function of an arbitrary computational problem.",

Remarkably, as the data set size is increased the quantum physical reservoir computer quickly starts out perform the conventional neural network. Furthermore, quantum physical reservoir computer provides superior effectiveness against number of training epochs at a set data set size and outperformed the neural network approach at every epoch number sampled. Finally, we have deployed the quantum physical reservoir computer approach to explore the quantum problem associated with the dynamics of open quantum systems in which an atomic system ensemble interacts with a structured photonic reservoir associated with a photonic band gap material.
