When the Hubble horizon is taken as a cosmological length scale, the effective equation of state of horizon cosmological constant is quintessence-like. The values of model parameter $c$ will determine the current status of our universe. When particle horizon is taken as the cosmological length scale, non viable cosmological model can be obtained for the requirement of $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}<1/3$ which conflicts with current comic observations. When the future event horizon is taken as the role of cosmological length scale, the forms of effective equation of state of horizon cosmological constants are the the same as the holographic ones.

This is done through developing coupled rate equations for radiation, dust, and dark components.

    "summary": "Cosmological observables are used to construct cosmological models. Since cosmological observations are limited to the light cone, a fixed number of observables (even measured to arbitrary accuracy) may not uniquely determine a cosmological model without additional assumptions or considerations. A prescription for constructing a spherically symmetric, inhomogeneous cosmological model that exactly reproduces the luminosity-distance as a function of redshift and the light-cone mass density as a function of redshift of a $\\Lambda$CDM model is employed to gain insight into how an inhomogeneous cosmological model might mimic dark energy models.",

One line of enquiry to probe this idea is to understand processes in our cosmological history in terms of York time. Following a review of the theoretical motivations, we focus on slow-roll inflation and the freezing and Hubble re-entry of cosmological perturbations. We show how the mathematical account of these processes is distinct from the conventional account in terms of standard cosmological or conformal time. We also consider the cosmological York-timeline more broadly and contrast it with the conventional cosmological timeline.",

    "summary": "General relativity manifests very similar equations in different regimes, notably in large scale cosmological perturbation theory, non-linear cosmological structure formation, and in weak field galactic dynamics. The same is not necessarily true in alternative gravity theories, in particular those that possess MONDian behaviour (\"relativistic extensions\" of MOND). In these theories different regimes are typically studied quite separately, sometimes even with the freedom in the theories chosen differently in different regimes. If we wish to properly and fully test complete cosmologies containing MOND against the $\\Lambda$CDM paradigm then we need to understand cosmological structure formation on all scales, and do so in a coherent and consistent manner. We propose a method for doing so and apply it to generalised Einstein-Aether theories as a case study. We derive the equations that govern cosmological structure formation on all scales in these theories and show that the same free function (which may contain both Newtonian and MONDian branches) appears in the cosmological background, linear perturbations, and non-linear cosmological structure formation. We show that MONDian behaviour on galactic scales does not necessarily result in MONDian behaviour on cosmological scales, and for MONDian behaviour to arise cosmologically, there will be no modification to the Friedmann equations governing the evolution of the homogeneous cosmological background. We comment on how existing N-body simulations relate to complete and consistent generalised Einstein-Aether cosmologies. The equations derived in this work allow consistent cosmological N-body simulations to be run in these theories whether or not MONDian behaviour manifests on cosmological scales.",
