    "title": "Towards open-closed string duality: Closed Strings as Open String Fields",
    "summary": "We establish a translation dictionary between open and closed strings, starting from open string field theory. Under this correspondence, (off-shell) level-matched closed string states are represented by star algebra projectors in open string field theory. Particular attention is paid to the zero mode sector, which is indispensable in order to generate closed string states with momentum. As an outcome of our identification, we show that boundary states, which in closed string theory represent D-branes, correspond to the identity string field in the open string side. It is to be remarked that closed string theory D-branes are thus given by an infinite superposition of star algebra projectors.",

    "summary": "Various studies have attempted to extend the Witten's cubic open string field theory to the cubic closed string field theory, which may describe Einstein gravity in the low energy sector consistently. In the present study we propose a cubic closed string field theory, introducing a double layer to describe the closed string world-sheet as an extension of the open string world-sheet of the Witten's cubic open string. We mapped the closed string world-sheet onto the complex plane, of which the lower half plane is completely covered by the extended part of the string world-sheet. Using the Green's function on the complex plane, evaluated the Polyakov string path integral, from which we extracted the Neumann functions and the vertex operators. We obtained the one and two string vertices (identities) following this procedure and finally the cubic string vertex operator. It is notable that the obtained cubic string scattering amplitude coincide with the cubic graviton interaction of the Einstein gravity. Thus, the resultant cubic closed string field theory consistently describes the Einstein gravity. We also show that the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) relations of the first quantized string theory may be manifested in the cubic closed string field theory.",

The various string theoretic methods used for this study include techniques of two dimensional conformal field theory, open string field theory, boundary string field theory, non-commutative solitons etc. We also describe various attempts to understand these results using field theoretic methods. These field theory models include toy models like singular potential models and p-adic string theory, as well as more realistic version of the tachyon effective action based on Dirac-Born-Infeld type action. Finally we study closed string background produced by the `decaying' unstable D-branes, both in the critical string theory and in the two dimensional string theory, and describe the open string completeness conjecture that emerges out of this study. According to this conjecture the quantum dynamics of an unstable D-brane system is described by an internally consistent quantum open string field theory without any need to couple the system to closed strings. Each such system can be regarded as a part of the `hologram' describing the full string theory.",

Especially, we show that the configurations satisfy the equations of motion of the string geometry model if and only if the embedded string backgrounds satisfy their equations of motion. This means that classical dynamics of the string backgrounds are described as a part of classical dynamics in string geometry theory.

In this paper, in the bosonic closed sector of string geometry theory, we identify string background configurations, which include general string backgrounds in bosonic closed string theory. From fluctuations around these configurations, we derive the path-integrals of perturbative strings on the string backgrounds up to any order. Furthermore, the identification of the string background configurations enables us to obtain differential equations that determine a potential for string backgrounds. We obtain a potential for perturbative vacua in string theory by substituting the string background configurations into the classical potential in string geometry theory and imposing the differential equations by the method of Lagrange multipliers. We also solve these differential equations and obtain a potential explicitly up to the second order without Lagrange multipliers.",

Because of supergravity potential, the bound-state string is pulled to the background fundamental strings, whose motion is described by open string rolling radion field. The string coupling can be made controllably weak and, in the limit $1 << g^2_{\\rm st} n << g^2_{\\rm st} N$, the bound-state energy involved is small compared to the string scale. We thus propose rolling dynamics of open string radion in this system as an exactly solvable analog for rolling dynamics of open string tachyon in decaying D-brane. The dynamics bears a novel feature that the worldsheet electric field increases monotonically to the critical value as the bound-state string falls into the background string. Close to the background string, D string constituent inside the bound-state string decouples from fundamental string constituents.",

    "summary": "It has recently been conjectured that the type IIA string theory compactified on K3 and the heterotic string theory compactified on a four dimensional torus describe identical string theories. The fundamental heterotic string can be regarded as a non-singular soliton solution of the type IIA string theory with a semi-infinite throat. We show that this solution admits 24 parameter non-singular deformation describing a fundamental heterotic string carrying electric charge and current. The charge is generated due to the coupling of the gauge fields to the anti-symmetric tensor field, and not to an explicit source term. This clarifies how soliton solutions carrying charge under the Ramond-Ramond fields can be constructed in the type IIA theory, and provides further support to the string string duality conjecture. Similarly, the fundamental type IIA string can be regarded as a non-singular solution of the heterotic string theory with a semi-infinite throat, but this solution does not admit any deformation representing charged string. This is also consistent with the expectation that a fundamental type IIA string does not carry any charge that couples to the fields originating in the Ramond-Ramond sector.",

Modelling baryon and meson as instanton and open string in the effective QCD string model, the typical pomeron is identified with a massive spin-2 closed string. According to the open-closed string duality, the massive spin-2 closed string is accompanied by the open-string singlet interaction with universal coupling. The flat space 4-point open-string singlet amplitudes and cross sections are computed in the Regge limit. Including both the open and closed string pomerons, we fit the differential cross-section with experimental data of the proton-proton and proton-antiproton scattering from the CDF, E-710, D0, LHC-ATLAS and LHC-TOTEM collaborations. The fitting results show the universality of the string mass scale~(or string tension) and consistency of the string model between the open and closed string parameters in describing the $pp$ and $p\\bar{p}$ scattering in the Regge limit. The fitting of the string model to experimental data gives the string scale $M_{S}\\simeq 1.7-1.8$ GeV and the corresponding glueball pole mass $m_{g}\\simeq 1.6-1.7$ GeV.

Making use of the first quantized open bosonic string in the proper time gauge, we convert the string amplitudes given by the Polyakov path integrals on string world sheets into those of the second quantized theory. The world sheet diagrams generated by the constructed open string field theory are planar in contrast to those of the Witten's cubic string field theory. However, the constructed string field theory is yet equivalent to the Witten's cubic string field theory. Having obtained planar diagrams, we may adopt the light-cone string field theory technique to calculate the multi-string scattering amplitudes with an arbitrary number of external strings. We examine in detail the three-string vertex diagram and the effective four-string vertex diagrams generated perturbatively by the three-string vertex at tree level. In the zero-slope limit, the string scattering amplitudes are identified precisely as those of non-Abelian Yang-Mills gauge theory if the external states are chosen to be massless vector particles.",

String states may then be understood as composed of SYM string bits. We investigate part of the low-lying spectrum of the tensionless (zero-coupling) limit and find a large number of states that are not present in the infinite tension (strong-coupling) limit, notably several massless spin two particles. We observe that all conformal dimensions are N-independent in the free SYM theory, implying that masses in the corresponding string theory are unchanged by string interactions. Degenerate string states do however mix in the interacting string theory because of the complicated N-dependence of general CFT two-point functions. Finally we verify the CFT crossing symmetry, which corresponds to the dual properties of string scattering amplitudes. This means that the SYM operator correlation functions define AdS dual models analogous to the Minkowski dual models that gave rise to string theory.",

    "summary": "We continue our study of the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) factorization of winding string amplitudes. In a toroidal compactification, amplitudes for winding closed string states factorize into products of amplitudes for open strings ending on an array of D-branes localized in the compactified directions; the specific D-brane configuration is determined by the closed string data. In this paper, we study a zero Regge slope limit of the KLT relations between winding string amplitudes. Such a limit of string theory requires a critically tuned Kalb-Ramond field in a compact direction, and leads to a self-contained corner called nonrelativistic string theory. This theory is unitary, ultraviolet complete, and its string spectrum and spacetime S-matrix satisfy nonrelativistic symmetry. Moreover, the asymptotic closed string states in nonrelativistic string theory necessarily carry nonzero windings. First, starting with relativistic string theory, we construct a KLT factorization of amplitudes for winding closed strings in the presence of a critical Kalb-Ramond field. Then, in the zero Regge limit, we uncover a KLT relation for amplitudes in nonrelativistic string theory. Finally, we show how such a relation can be reproduced from first principles in a purely nonrelativistic string theory setting. We will also discuss connections to the amplitudes of string theory in the discrete light cone quantization (DLCQ), a method that is relevant for Matrix theory.",

Nonrelativistic string theory is unitary, ultraviolet complete and has a string spectrum and spacetime S-matrix enjoying nonrelativistic symmetry. The worldsheet theory of nonrelativistic string theory is coupled to a curved spacetime background and to a Kalb-Ramond two-form and dilaton field. The appropriate spacetime geometry for nonrelativistic string theory is dubbed string Newton-Cartan geometry, which is distinct from Riemannian geometry. This defines the sigma model of nonrelativistic string theory describing strings propagating and interacting in curved background fields. We also implement T-duality transformations in the path integral of this sigma model and uncover the spacetime interpretation of T-duality. We show that T-duality along the longitudinal direction of the string Newton-Cartan geometry describes relativistic string theory on a Lorentzian geometry with a compact lightlike isometry, which is otherwise only defined by a subtle infinite boost limit. This relation provides a first principles definition of string theory in the discrete light cone quantization (DLCQ) in an arbitrary background, a quantization that appears in nonperturbative approaches to quantum field theory and string/M-theory, such as in Matrix theory. T-duality along a transverse direction of the string Newton-Cartan geometry equates nonrelativistic string theory in two distinct, T-dual backgrounds.",

Especially, we show that the configurations satisfy the equations of motion of the string geometry model in $\\alpha' \\to 0$ if and only if the embedded string backgrounds satisfy the equations of motion of the supergravities, respectively. This means that classical dynamics of the string backgrounds are described as a part of classical dynamics in string geometry theory.

The four-string scattering amplitudes with three tachyons and an arbitrary string state are calculated. The string field theory yields the string scattering amplitudes evaluated on the world sheet of string scattering whereas the coventional method, based on the first quantized theory brings us the string scattering amplitudes defined on the upper half plane. For the highest spin states, generated by the primary operators, both calculations are in perfect agreement. In this case, the string scattering amplitudes are invariant under the conformal transformation, which maps the string world sheet onto the upper half plane. If the external string states are general massive states, generated by non-primary field operators, we need to take into account carefully the conformal transformation between the world sheet and the upper half plane. We show by an explicit calculation that the string scattering amplitudes calculated by using the deformed cubic string field theory transform into those of the first quantized theory on the upper half plane by the conformal transformation, generated by the Schwarz-Christoffel mapping.",

We use insights from string field theory to give finite expressions for the string theory amplitudes for real energies. We also show analytically that the imaginary parts of the string theory amplitudes computed this way reproduce the full matrix model results for general scattering amplitudes involving multiple closed strings.",

    "summary": "Under certain conditions the collision and intercommutation of two cosmic strings can result in the formation of a third string, with the three strings then remaining connected at Y-junctions. The kinematics and dynamics of collisions of this type have been the subject of analytical and numerical analyses in the special case in which the strings are Nambu-Goto. Cosmic strings, however, may well carry currents, in which case their dynamics is not given by the Nambu-Goto action. Our aim is to extend the kinematic analysis to more general kinds of string model. We focus in particular on the collision of strings described by conservative elastic string models, characteristic of current carrying strings, and which are expected to form in a cosmological context. As opposed to Nambu-Goto strings collisions, we show that in this case the collision cannot lead to the formation of a third elastic string: if dynamically such a string forms then the joining string must be described by a more general equation of state. This process will be studied numerically in a forthcoming publication.",

    "summary": "A method to study electromagnetic (EM) effects generated by a straight null cosmic string moving in classical EM fields is suggested. The string is shown to induce an additional EM field which can be described as a solution to homogeneous Maxwell equations with initial data set on a null surface, the string event horizon, where the string world-sheet belongs to. The initial data ensure the required holonomy of the string space-time caused by the gravity of the string. This characteristic initial value problem is used to study interaction of plane waves with null strings and perturbations by the strings of the Coulomb fields of electric charges. It is shown that parts of an incoming EM wave crossing the string horizon from different sides of the string are refracted with respect to each other and leave behind the string a wedge-like region of interference. A null string moving near an electric charge results in two effects: it creates a self-force of the charge and induces a pulse of EM radiation traveling away from the charge in the direction close to trajectory of the string.",

We studied a graviton and massive symmetric rank-two tensor in string theory, both of which carry spin two. A graviton is a massless spin-two particle in closed string theory while a symmetric rank-two tensor is a massive particle with spin two in open string theory. Using Polyakov's string path integral formulation of string scattering amplitudes, we calculated cubic interactions of both spin-two particles explicitly, including $\\ap$-corrections (string corrections). We observed that the cubic interactions of the massive spin-two particle differed from those of the graviton. The massive symmetric rank-two tensor in open string theory becomes massless in the high energy limit where $\\ap \\rightarrow \\infty$ and $\\ap$-correction terms, containing higher derivatives, dominate: In this limit the local cubic action of the symmetric rank-two tensor of open string theory coincides with that of the graviton in closed string theory.",

    "summary": "We review recent developments on nonrelativistic string theory. In flat spacetime, the theory is defined by a two-dimensional relativistic quantum field theory with nonrelativistic global symmetries acting on the worldsheet fields. This theory arises as a self-contained corner of relativistic string theory. It has a string spectrum with a Galilean dispersion relation, and a spacetime S-matrix with nonrelativistic symmetry. This string theory also gives a unitary and ultraviolet complete framework that connects different corners of string theory, including matrix string theory and noncommutative open strings. In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the non-Lorentzian geometries and quantum field theories that arise from nonrelativistic string theory in background fields. In this review, we start with an introduction to the foundations of nonrelativistic string theory in flat spacetime. We then give an overview of recent progress, including the appropriate target-space geometry that nonrelativistic strings couple to. This is known as (torsional) string Newton-Cartan geometry, which is neither Lorentzian nor Riemannian. We also give a review of nonrelativistic open strings and effective field theories living on D-branes. Finally, we discuss applications of nonrelativistic strings to decoupling limits in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence.",

Extending the NS background fields to a supergravity multiplet, we verify that all solutions we find are half-supersymmetric. The two perturbative solutions we find both have an interpretation as the background geometry outside a string-like object. Correspondingly, we refer to these non-Lorentzian backgrounds as winding string and unwound string solution. Whereas the winding string is part of the on-shell spectrum of non-relativistic string theory, the unwound string only makes sense off-shell where it mediates the instantaneous gravitational force. Seen from the nine-dimensional point of view, we find that the winding string solution is sourced by a non-relativistic massive particle and that the unwound string solution is sourced by a massless Galilean particle of zero colour and spin. We explain how these two string solutions fit into a discrete lightcone quantization of string theory. We shortly discuss the basic NS five-brane and Kaluza-Klein monopole solutions and show that they are both half-supersymmetric.",

    "summary": "This elementary introduction to string field theory highlights the features and the limitations of this approach to quantum gravity as it is currently understood. String field theory is a formulation of string theory as a field theory in space-time with an infinite number of massive fields. Although existing constructions of string field theory require expanding around a fixed choice of space-time background, the theory is in principle background-independent, in the sense that different backgrounds can be realized as different field configurations in the theory. String field theory is the only string formalism developed so far which, in principle, has the potential to systematically address questions involving multiple asymptotically distinct string backgrounds. Thus, although it is not yet well defined as a quantum theory, string field theory may eventually be helpful for understanding questions related to cosmology in string theory.",
