    "title": "Identical Particles in Quantum Mechanics",
    "summary": "If, in a system of identical particles, the one particle state is defined by the partial trace to one of the component spaces of the total Hilbert space, then all one particle states are identical. The particles are indistinguishable. This is often thought to be a typical quantum mechanical phenomenon. I will show however that an analogous procedure to define particle states exists in classical mechanics, which results in classical indistinguishable identical particles. From this analogy it follows that the indistinguishability of identical particles depends on how we define particle states. It is not an inevitable result of the symmetry postulate.   Indeed, if particles are defined by partial traces, consistent use of the symmetry postulate leads to the conclusion that all identical particles in the universe are indistinguishable, so that particles can never be pointed at, not even in the classical limit. This does not correspond to the way the term particle is actually used in practice. I will argue that a particle should be defined in such a way that in the classical limit the quantum particle state becomes the state of a classical particle. This will lead us to a definition of particles which is in line with the way the term particle is actually used by physicists.",

    "title": "Predicting the impact of particle-particle collisions on turbophoresis   with a reduced number of computational particles",
    "summary": "A common feature of wall-bounded turbulent particle-laden flows is enhanced particle concentrations in a thin layer near the wall due to a phenomenon known as turbophoresis. Even at relatively low bulk volume fractions, particle-particle collisions regulate turbophoresis in a critical way, making simulations sensitive to collisional effects. Lagrangian tracking of every particle in the flow can become computationally expensive when the physical number of particles in the system is large. Artificially reducing the number of particles in the simulation can mitigate the computational cost. When particle-particle collisions are an important aspect determining the simulation outcome, as in the case when turbophoresis plays an active role, simply reducing the number of particles in the simulation significantly alters the computed particle statistics. This paper introduces a computational particle treatment for particle-particle collisions which reproduces the results of a full simulation with a reduced number of particles. This is accomplished by artificially enhancing the particle collision radius based on scaling laws for the collision rates. The proposed method retains the use of deterministic collision models and is applicable for both low and high Stokes number regimes.",

    "title": "Implications of detecting the Axion-Like Particles in Astro-Particle   Physics",
    "summary": "Axions and axion like particles in general are consequences of the extensions of the standard model in particle physics. Axions have been proposed as hypothetical pseudo-scalar particles in particle physics to solve the strong Charge-Parity problem using quantum chromodynamics. These particles are also proposed to be an attractive candidate for cold dark matter in the Universe. The current understanding of the existence and properties of the axions is not very clear and these hypothetical particles remain elusive. However many theoretical and experimental searches are being made for understanding and constraining the properties of axions via detection of axion like particles. The term axion like particles is used to include different types of axions going beyond the standard model. In this paper, we review the different physical properties of axions and axion like particles and their possible sources in the laboratory and Universe. We discuss different experimental set ups for detection of axion like particles proposed in the literature. Implications of detecting the axion like particles in the areas of particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology are also discussed in the framework of present and future motivations.",

    "summary": "Thermal radiation in particulate media has been extensively modeled by solving the radiative transport equation with effective radiative properties or with statistical ray tracing techniques. While effective for static particles, this approach is not compatible with the more common discrete formulation of heat fluxes in particle flow systems. This study focuses on such a discrete approach to compute radiative fluxes by developing view factors correlations. Training data is generated from physics-based Monte Carlo ray tracing simulations on a monodisperse, packed bed with solid volume fractions ranging from 0.016 to 0.45. This data was used to develop reduced-order correlations to determine particle-particle and particle-wall radiative view factors as a function of particle-particle and particle-wall separation distance, viewing angle, and the number of shading particles. Uniquely, we determine best-fit functions that are physically interpretable to account for shading effects by particles. A sigmoid function with a non-linear dependence on viewing angle governs the extent of shading cast by an intermediate particle. To scale the net contribution of shading by intermediate particles between a particle and a planar wall, a particle-wall correction factor that is dependent quadratically on the particle-wall normal separation distance serves to be effective. View factor correlations result in reliable and reasonably accurate predictions. For a solid volume fraction of 0.45, the root mean squared errors of particle-particle and particle-wall view factors are 2.7e-4 and 0.021 with data in the ranges of 0-0.08 and 0-0.5 respectively. With thousands of particles, the computational cost of proposed correlations with thresholding of 5 shading particles is about 100 times faster than serial Monte Carlo ray tracing simulations for a solid volume fraction of 0.45.",

    "summary": "Since the particles such as molecules, atoms and nuclei are composite particles, it is important to recognize that physics must be invariant for the composite particles and their constituent particles, this requirement is called particle invariance in this paper. But difficulties arise immediately because for fermion we use Dirac equation, for meson we use Klein-Gordon equation and for classical particle we use Newtonian mechanics, while the connections between these equations are quite indirect. Thus if the particle invariance is held in physics, i.e., only one physical formalism exists for any particle, we can expect to find out the differences between these equations by employing the particle invariance. As the results, several new relationships between them are found, the most important result is that the obstacles that cluttered the path from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics are found, it becomes possible to derive the quantum wave equations from relativistic mechanics after the obstacles are removed. An improved model is proposed to gain a better understanding on elementary particle interactions. This approach offers enormous advantages, not only for giving the first physically reasonable interpretation of quantum mechanics, but also for improving quark model.",

    "summary": "The test particle approach is a widely used method for studying the dynamics of charged particles in complex electromagnetic fields and has been successful in explaining particle energization in turbulent plasmas. However, this approach is fundamentally not self-consistent, as test particles do not generate their own electromagnetic fields and therefore do not interact with their surroundings realistically. In this work, we compare the energization of a population of test protons in a magnetofluid to that of a plasma composed of self-consistent particles. We use a compressible Hall magnetohydrodynamic (CHMHD) model for the test particle case and a hybrid particle-in-cell (HPIC) approach for the self-consistent case, conducting both 2D and 3D simulations. We calculate the rate of energization and conversion to thermal energy in both models, finding a higher temperature for the test particle case. Additionally, we examine the distribution of suprathermal particles and find that, in the test particle scenario, these particles eventually occupy the entire domain, while in the self-consistent case, suprathermal particles are confined to specific regions. We conclude that while test particles capture some qualitative features of their self-consistent counterparts, they miss finer phenomena and tend to overestimate energization.",

These rotators deterministically scatter the particles to the left (right), changing orientation from left to right (right to left) after scattering a particle. This interplay between the scatterers and the particle's motion causes a single particle to propagate in one direction away from its initial position. For multiple particles we show that the particles' dynamics can be vastly different. Specifically, we show that a particle can become entangled with another particle potentially causing the particle's trajectory to become periodic and that this can happen when the particles have the same or differing speeds. We describe two classes of periodic orbits based on the particles' initial velocities. We also describe how a particle with an unbounded past trajectory implies that some, possibly other, particle(s) has an unbounded future trajectory in this and other related multiparticle models.",

    "summary": "According to classical physics particles are basic building blocks of the world. Classical particles are distinguishable objects, individuated by physical characteristics. By contrast, in quantum mechanics the standard view is that particles of the same kind (\"identical particles\") are in all circumstances indistinguishable from each other. This indistinguishability doctrine is motivated by the (anti)symmetrization postulates together with the assumption (``factorism'') that each single particle is represented in exactly one factor space in the tensor product Hilbert space of a many-particles system.   Although the factorist assumption is standard in the literature, it is conceptually problematic. Particle indistinguishability is incompatible with the everyday meaning of ``particle'', and also with how this term is used both in classical physics and in the experimental practice of physics. The standard view requires quantum particles of the same kind to remain indistinguishable even in the classical limit, so that a transition to the classical picture of the world seems impossible.   Earlier we have proposed an alternative conception of quantum particles that does not rely on factorism and that avoids these and other problems. We further explain and develop this proposal here. In our view, particles in quantum theory are not fundamental but \\emph{emergent}. However, in those situations where the particle concept is applicable, quantum particles---identical or not---are distinguishable in the same way as classical particles.",

    "summary": "Usage, manipulation, transport, delivery, and mixing of granular or particulate media, comprised of spherical or polyhedral particles, is commonly encountered in industrial sectors of construction (cement and rock fragments), pharmaceutics (tablets), and transportation (ballast). Elucidating particulate media's behavior in concert with particle attrition (i.e., particle wear and subsequent particle fragmentation) is essential for predicting the performance and increasing the efficiency of engineering systems using such media. Discrete element method (DEM) based techniques can describe the interaction between particles but cannot model intra-particle deformation, especially intra-particle fracture. On the other hand, peridynamics provides the means to account for intra-particle deformation and fracture due to contact forces between particles. The present study proposes a hybrid model referred to as \\textit{PeriDEM} that combines the advantages of peridynamics and DEM. The model parameters can be tuned to achieve desired DEM contact forces, damping effects, and intra-particle stiffness. Two particle impacts and compressive behavior of multi-particle systems are thoroughly investigated. The model can account for any arbitrarily shaped particle in general. Spherical, hexagonal, and non-convex particle shapes are simulated in the present study. The effect of mesh resolution on intra-particle peridynamics is explicitly studied. The proposed hybrid model opens a new avenue to explore the complicated interactions encountered in discrete particle dynamics that involve the formation of force chains, particle interlocking, particle attrition, wear, and the eventual breakage.",

In the present study, the effect of particles with nontrivial radii on morphology of particle laden flows is explicitly considered, and dependence of radius and concentration of particles on the bump structure is extracted.",

In particular, this extended two--particle Green's function satisfies Dyson's equation and its self energy has the same analytic structure as the the self energy of the single--particle Green's function. For the case of a system interacting by one--particle potentials only, the two--particle self energy takes on a particularly simple form, just like the common self energy does. The new two--particle self energy also serves as a well behaved optical potential for the elastic scattering of a two--particle projectile by a many--body target. Due to its analytic structure, the two--particle self energy avoids divergences that appear with effective potentials derived by other means.",

    "summary": "Activity and self-generated motion are fundamental features observed in many living and non-living systems. Given that inter-particle adhesive forces are known to regulate particle dynamics, we investigate how adhesion strength controls the boundary growth and roughness in an active particle aggregate. Using particle based simulations incorporating both activity (birth, death and growth) and systematic physical interactions (elasticity and adhesion), we establish that inter-particle adhesion strength ($f^{ad}$) controls the surface roughness of a densely packed three-dimensional(3D) active particle aggregate expanding into a highly viscous medium. We discover that the surface roughness of a 3D active particle aggregate increases in proportion to the inter-particle adhesion strength, $f^{ad}$. We show that asymmetry in the radial and tangential active particle mean squared displacement (MSD) suppresses 3D surface roughness at lower adhesion strengths. By analyzing the statistical properties of particle displacements at the aggregate periphery, we determine that the 3D surface roughness is driven by the movement of active particle towards the core at high inter-particle adhesion strengths. Our results elucidate the physics controlling the expansion of adhesive 3D active particle collectives into a highly viscous medium, with implications into understanding stochastic interface growth in active matter systems characterized by self generated particle flux.",

Due to the coupling of the particles' energy-momentum tensor to the tension of the brane, the particle is semi-confined and oscillates along the extra dimension. We demonstrate that the frequency of these oscillations is proportional to the kinetic energy of the particle in the brane. We show that the classical stability of particle trajectories on the brane gives us the Bohr--Sommerfeld quantization condition. The particle's motion along the extra dimension allows us to formulate a geometrical version of the uncertainty principle. Furthermore, we exhibited that the particle's motion along the extra dimension is identical to the time-independent Schr\\\"odinger equation. The dynamics of a free particle, particles in a box, a harmonic oscillator, a bouncing particle, and tunneling are re-examined. We show that the particle's motion along the extra dimension yields a quantized energy spectrum for bound states.",

    "summary": "In this paper, a unified gas-kinetic wave-particle scheme (UGKWP) for the disperse dilute gas-particle multiphase flow is proposed. The gas phase is always in the hydrodynamic regime. However, the particle phase covers different flow regimes from particle trajectory crossing to the hydrodynamic wave interaction with the variation of local particle phase Knudsen number. The UGKWP is an appropriate method for the capturing of the multiscale transport mechanism in the particle phase through its coupled wave-particle formulation. In the regime with intensive particle collision, the evolution of solid particle will be followed by the analytic wave with quasi-equilibrium distribution; while in the rarefied regime the non-equilibrium particle phase will be captured through particle tracking and collision, which plays a decisive role in recovering particle trajectory crossing behavior. The gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) is employed for the simulation of gas flow. In the highly collision regime for the particles, no particles will be sampled in UGKWP and the wave formulation for solid particle with the hydrodynamic gas phase will reduce the system to the two-fluid Eulerian model. On the other hand, in the collisionless regime for the solid particle, the free transport of solid particle will be followed in UGKWP, and coupled system will return to the Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation for the gas and particle. The scheme will be tested for in all flow regimes, which include the non-equilibrium particle trajectory crossing, the particle concentration under different Knudsen number, and the dispersion of particle flow with the variation of Stokes number. A experiment of shock-induced particle bed fluidization is simulated and the results are compared with experimental measurements. These numerical solutions validate suitability of the proposed scheme for the simulation of gas-particle multiphase flow.",

    "title": "What is a particle?",
    "summary": "Theoretical developments related to the gravitational interaction have questioned the notion of particle in quantum field theory (QFT). For instance, uniquely-defined particle states do not exist in general, in QFT on a curved spacetime. More in general, particle states are difficult to define in a background-independent quantum theory of gravity. These difficulties have lead some to suggest that in general QFT should not be interpreted in terms of particle states, but rather in terms of eigenstates of local operators. Still, it is not obvious how to reconcile this view with the empirically-observed ubiquitous particle-like behavior of quantum fields, apparent for instance in experimental high-energy physics, or \"particle\"-physics. Here we offer an element of clarification by observing that already in flat space there exist --strictly speaking-- two distinct notions of particles: globally defined $n$-particle Fock-states and *local particle states*. The last describe the physical objects detected by finite-size particle detectors and are eigenstates of local field operators. In the limit in which the particle detectors are appropriately large, global and local particle states converge in a weak topology (but not in norm). This observation has little relevance for flat-space theories --it amounts to a reminder that there are boundary effects in realistic detectors--; but is relevant for gravity. It reconciles the two points of view mentioned above. More importantly, it provides a definition of local particle state that remains well-defined even when the conventional global particle states are not defined. This definition plays an important role in quantum gravity.",

    "title": "UGKWP method for polydisperse gas-solid particle multiphase flow",
    "summary": "In this paper, a unified algorithm will be proposed for the study of gas-solid particle multiphase flow. The gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) is used to simulate the continuum gas phase and the multiscale unified gas-kinetic wave-particle (UGKWP) method is developed for the multiple dispersed solid particle phase. At the same time, the momentum and energy exchanges between gas-particle phases will be included under the GKS-UGKWP framework. For each disperse solid particle phase, the decomposition of deterministic wave and statistic particle in UGKWP is based on the local cell's Knudsen number. This is very significant for simulating dispersed particle phases at different Knudsen numbers due to the variation of physical properties in individual particle phase, such as the particle diameter, material density, and the corresponding mass fraction inside each control volume. For the gas phase, the GKS is basically an Eulerian approach for the NS solution. Therefore, the GKS-UGKWP method for the gas-particle flow unifies the Eulerian-Eulerian (EE) and Eulerian-Lagrangian (EL) methods. An optimal strategy can be obtained for the solid particle phase with the consideration of physical accuracy and numerical efficiency. Two cases of gas-solid fluidization system, i.e., one circulating fluidized bed and one turbulent fluidized bed, are simulated. The typical flow structures of the fluidized particles are captured, and the time-averaged variables of the flow field agree well with the experimental measurements. In addition, the shock particle-bed interaction is studied by the proposed GKS-UGKWP, which validates the method for polydisperse gas-particle system in the supersonic case, where the dynamic evolution process of the particle cloud is investigated.",

But it does not play a special role in the issue of entanglement, which depends on the single-particle basis chosen. The nonfactorization due to (anti)symmetrization is naturally excluded by using the (anti)symmetrized basis or, equivalently, the particle number representation. The natural degrees of freedom in quantifying the identical-particle entanglement in a chosen single-particle basis are occupation numbers of different single particle basis states.

    "summary": "Grain segregation occurs under various conditions, such as vibration, shear and mixing. In the gravity-driven shear flow, size segregation is triggered by the percolation of small particles through the opened voids (kinetic sieving), and large particles are accumulated in the upper layer. One hypothesis for the upward migration of large particles is the squeeze expulsion mechanism, which remains yet ambiguous due to limited evidences from either physical or numerical experiments. Here we show statistically how the percolation of small particles facilitates the upward movement of large particles. We found that in large particles, the mechanical anisotropy (strong force network) coincides with the geometric anisotropy (contact network), which indicates squeeze, and the connectivity of large particles is much higher when they are squeezed through small particles. The presence of small particles filling the voids hinders the downward movements and provides dynamic steps for the climbing large particles. Furthermore, increasing the coefficient of friction promotes rotation and empowers more large particles to reach the top layer, implying that the climbing particles tend to rotate relative to their neighbors. Our findings of the microstructure and movement pattern of individual particles add new evidences to the mechanism of squeeze expulsion and provide new perspective for the study of segregation.",

These active interactions also underpin collective behavior in biological systems. Here we study a general setting of active particles in a bath of passive particles, and demonstrate a novel mechanism for long range attraction between active particles. The mechanism operates when the translational persistence length of the active particle motion is smaller than the particle diameter. In this limit, the system reduces to particles of higher diffusivity (\"hot\" particles) in a bath of particles with lower diffusivity (\"cold\" particles). This attractive interaction arises as a hot particle pushes cold particles away to create a large hole around itself, and the holes interact via a depletion-like attraction. Strikingly, the interaction range is more than an order of magnitude larger than the particle radius, well beyond the range of conventional depletion force. Although the mechanism occurs outside the parameter regime of typical biological swimmers, the mechanism could be realized in the laboratory.",

We achieve this by reformulating the particle relaxation as an optimization problem. The objective function is an integral difference between discrete particle-based and smoothed-analytical volume fractions. The analysis demonstrates that the particle relaxation method in the domain interior is essentially equivalent to employing a gradient descent approach to solve this optimization problem, and we can extend such an equivalence to the bounded domain by introducing a proper boundary term. Additionally, each periodic particle distribution has a spatially uniform particle volume, denoted as characteristic volume. The relaxed particle distribution has the largest characteristic volume, and the kernel cut-off radius determines this volume. This insight enables us to control the relaxed particle distribution by selecting the target kernel cut-off radius for a given kernel function.",

Three-particle jet-like azimuthal correlation and three-particle azimuthal cumulant have been analyzed in experiments in attempt to distinguish conical emission of jet-correlated particles from other physics mechanisms. We investigate the difference between three-particle jet-like correlation and three-particle cumulant in azimuth. We show, under the circumstance where the away-side two-particle correlation is relatively flat in azimuth and similar in magnitude to the azimuthal average of the two-particle correlation signal, that the three-particle cumulant cannot distinguish conical emission from other physics mechanisms. The three-particle jet-like correlation, on the other hand, retains its discrimination power.",

    "summary": "According to Quantum Mechanics, the particles can exhibit either particle properties or wave properties depending on the experimental set up (wave-particle dualism). A special behavior occurs for a system of two entangled particles 1 and 2 that propagate along two different directions in the space. In such a case, the entangled particle 2 should exhibit either the particle behavior or the wave behavior depending on the kind of measurement that is performed on particle 1 whatever is the actual distance between the two particles. The apparently surprising fact is that the \"choice\" of what kind of measurement is performed on particle 1 can be also made when particle 2 has been already detected (delayed-choice quantum eraser).These theoretical predictions have been confirmed by the experiments and seem to suggest that a future measurement can affect a past event. Recently, both the concepts of \"delayed choice\" and of \"quantum erasure\" have been criticized by Ellerman and by Kastner. In this paper we propose an alternative analysis of the delayed-choice quantum eraser with two entangled particles and we show that it does not imply an inversion of the natural cause-effect temporal order of the physical events.",

    "summary": "Quantum multi-particle correlations are one of the most intriguing properties of quantum entanglement, arising from collective entangled states of multiple particles. Svetlichny's inequality (SI) was the first method proposed to test the existence of such correlations. Previous studies have primarily focused on $1/2$-spin particle systems. In this paper, we present a unified scheme that enables the violation of SI in arbitrary non-zero spin particle systems. Specifically, for all fermion systems, our scheme achieves the maximal quantum violation of SI for any number of particles. For boson systems, when the particle spin $j\\geq2$, our scheme consistently realizes the violation of SI for any number of particles. When the particle spin $j=1$, our scheme can yield SI violation for up to $7$ particles. Furthermore, as the particle spin $j$ approaches infinity, our scheme achieves the maximal quantum violation of SI. To obtain these results, we also prove that the upper bound of Svetlichny's operator within the framework of local hidden variable theory is $\\sqrt{2^{N+1}}$. These findings not only enhance our understanding of quantum correlations across various particle systems but also provide valuable insights for the development of quantum communication protocols that utilize entanglement and non-locality in multi-particle configurations.",

    "summary": "Propagation of energetic particles across the mean field direction in turbulent magnetic fields is often described as spatial diffusion. Recently, it has been suggested that initially the particles propagate systematically along meandering field lines, and only later reach the time-asymptotic diffusive cross-field propagation. In this paper, we analyse cross-field propagation of 1--100 MeV protons in composite 2D-slab turbulence superposed on a constant background magnetic field, using full-orbit particle simulations, to study the non-diffusive phase of particle propagation with a wide range of turbulence parameters. We show that the early-time non-diffusive propagation of the particles is consistent with particle propagation along turbulently meandering field lines. This results in a wide cross-field extent of the particles already at the initial arrival of particles to a given distance along the mean field direction, unlike when using spatial diffusion particle transport models. The cross-field extent of the particle distribution remains constant for up to tens of hours in turbulence environment consistent with the inner heliosphere during solar energetic particle events. Subsequently, the particles escape from their initial meandering field lines, and the particle propagation across the mean field reaches time-asymptotic diffusion. Our analysis shows that in order to understand solar energetic particle event origins, particle transport modelling must include non-diffusive particle propagation along meandering field lines.",

    "summary": "We study multicomponent liquids by increasing the mass of $15\\%$ of the particles in a binary Kob-Andersen model. We find that the heavy particles have dual effects on the lighter particles. At higher temperatures, there is a significant decoupling of the dynamics between heavier and lighter particles, with the former resembling a pinned particle to the latter. The dynamics of the lighter particles slow down due to the excluded volume around the nearly immobile heavier particles. Conversely, at lower temperatures, there is a coupling between the dynamics of the heavier and lighter particles. The heavier particles' mass slows down the dynamics of both types of particles. This makes the soft pinning effect of the heavy particles questionable in this regime. We demonstrate that as the mass of the heavy particles increases, the coupling of the dynamics between the lighter and heavier particles weakens. Consequently, the heavier the mass of the heavy particles, the more effectively they act as soft pinning centres in both high and low-temperature regimes. A key finding is that akin to the pinned system, the self and collective dynamics of the lighter particles decouple from each other as the mass of the heavy particles has a more pronounced impact on the latter. We analyze the structure dynamics correlation by considering the system under the binary and modified quaternary framework, the latter describing the pinned system. Our findings indicate that whenever the heavy mass particles function as soft pinning centres, the modified quaternary framework predicts a higher correlation.",

But difficulties arise immediately because for fermion we use the Dirac equation, for boson we use the Klein-Gordon equation. Therefore, the particle invariance demands there is a general wave equation for describing particle motion regardless particle class. In this paper, three advances in this subject are reported: (1) momentum-wavefunction relation is a general relation shared by both fermion and boson, meets the requirement of the particle invaiance. As a test, the momentum-wavefunction relation was directly applied to hydrogen atom, and get the correct fine structure and spin effect for the electron. (2) the Dirac equation and Klein-Gordon equation can be derived out from the momentum-wavefunction relation when we abandon some higher order terms. (3) according to the momentum-wavefunction relation a path integral method was developed, differing from Feynman's path integral, it simplfies quantum computation.",

    "summary": "The origin of large and small particle axial bands in long rotating tumblers is a long-standing question. Using DEM simulations, we show that this axial segregation is due to a Rayleigh-Taylor instability which is characterized by the fact that the density of a granular medium increases with mixing and decreases with segregation. For initially mixed particles, segregation and collisional diffusion in the flowing layer balance and lead to a three-layer system, with a layer of large particles over a layer of small particles, and, interposed between these layers, a layer of more densely packed mixed particles. The higher density mixed particle layer over the lower density small particle layer induces a Rayleigh-Taylor instability, evident as waviness in the interface between the layers. The waviness destabilizes into ascending plumes of small particles and descending plumes of mixed particles with large particles enriched near the surface, which become evident as small and large particle bands visible at the free surface. Rolls driven by segregation at the tilted interface between plumes maintain the pattern of frozen plumes. Published by the American Physical Society 2024",

    "summary": "[A brief review intended for a general physics colloquium audience.] Astrophysicists now know that 80% of the matter in the universe is `dark matter', composed of neutral and weakly interacting elementary particles that are not part of the Standard Model of particle physics. I will summarize the evidence for dark matter. I will explain why I expect dark matter particles to be produced at the CERN LHC. We will then need to characterize the new weakly interacting particles and demonstrate that they are the same particles that are found in the cosmos. I will describe how this might be done.",

    "summary": "We give an argument that a broad class of geometric models of spinning relativistic particles with Casimir mass and spin being separately fixed parameters, have indeterminate worldline (while other spinning particles have definite worldline). This paradox suggests that for a consistent description of spinning particles something more general than a worldline concept should be used. As a particular case, we study at the Lagrangian level the Cauchy problem for a spinor particle and then, at the constrained Hamiltonian level, we generalize our result to other particles.",

These methods preserve momentum and energy exactly when the simulation particles have equal weights. However, when the interacting particles are of varying weight, these physical conservation laws are only preserved on average. Here, we 1) extend these methods to weighted particles such that the scattering physics is correct on average, and 2) describe a new method for adjusting the particle velocities post scatter to restore exact conservation of momentum and energy. The efficacy of the model is illustrated with various test problems.",
