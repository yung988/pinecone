    "summary": "The QCD axion or axion-like particles are candidates of dark matter of the universe. On the other hand, axion-like excitations exist in certain condensed matter systems, which implies that there can be interactions of dark matter particles with condensed matter axions. We discuss the relationship between the condensed matter axion and a collective spin-wave excitation in an anti-ferromagnetic insulator at the quantum level. The conversion rate of the light dark matter, such as the elementary particle axion or hidden photon, into the condensed matter axion is estimated for the discovery of the dark matter signals.",

We provide an alternative picture for the initial appearance of strings/vortices that is commensurate with all the experimental evidence from condensed matter and consider some of its implications for QFT.",

Transitions into thermal states with ordered superradiant phases have been shown to theoretically exist in Dicke-Preparata models.

The microscopic bases of Dicke-Preparata thermal superradiance for realistic macroscopic systems are explored in this work. The impossibility of diaelectric correlations in condensed matter systems (via the Landau-Lifshitz theorem) provides a strong theoretical basis for understanding the physical reality of condensed matter thermodynamic superradiant phases.",

    "summary": "Taking the vector kaon-quark interaction into account, we reexamine in detail the neutral kaon condensation in color-flavor locked quark matter. It is found that the pairing phenomena in the quark matter are somewhat influenced by $K^0$ condensation. Different from the previous predictions, we find that the $K^0$ condensed phase might no longer be more stable than the normal phase even if $K^0$ condensation can occur in the color-flavor locked matter.",

    "summary": "Computational scientists have long been developing a diverse portfolio of methodologies to characterise condensed matter systems. Most of the descriptors resulting from these efforts are ultimately based on the spatial configurations of particles, atoms, or molecules within these systems. Noteworthy examples include symmetry functions and the smooth overlap of atomic positions (SOAP) descriptors, which have significantly advanced the performance of predictive machine learning models for both condensed matter and small molecules. However, while graph-based descriptors are frequently employed in machine learning models to predict the functional properties of small molecules, their application in the context of condensed matter has been limited. In this paper, we put forward a number of graph-based descriptors (such as node centrality and clustering coefficients) traditionally utilised in network science, as alternative representations for condensed matter systems. We apply this graph-based formalism to investigate the dynamical properties and phase transitions of the prototypical Lennard-Jones system. We find that our graph-based formalism outperforms symmetry function descriptors in predicting the dynamical properties and phase transitions of this system. These results demonstrate the broad applicability of graph-based features in representing condensed matter systems, paving the way for exciting advancements in the field of condensed matter through the integration of network science concepts.",

In the Bose-Einstein Condensation model, dark matter can be described as a non-relativistic, Newtonian gravitational condensate, whose density and pressure are related by a barotropic equation of state, with barotropic index equal to one. In the present work, we study the Bose-Einstein Condensation process in a cosmological context, by assuming that this process can be described (at least approximately) as a first order phase transition. We analyze the evolution of the physical quantities relevant for the physical description of the early universe, namely, the energy density, temperature and scale factor, before, during and after the Bose-Einstein Condensation (phase transition). We also consider in detail the epoch when the universe evolved through a mixed condensate - normal dark matter phase, with a monotonically growing Bose-Einstein dark matter component. An important parameter characterizing the Bose-Einstein Condensation is the condensate dark matter fraction, whose time evolution describes the time dynamics of the conversion process. The behavior of this parameter during the cosmological condensation process is also analyzed in detail. To study the cosmological dynamics and evolution we use both analytical and numerical methods. The presence of the condensate dark matter and of the Bose-Einstein phase transition could have modified drastically the cosmological evolution of the early universe, as well as the large scale structure formation process.",

Zero temperature condensed dark matter can be described as a non-relativistic, Newtonian gravitational condensate, whose density and pressure are related by a barotropic equation of state, with barotropic index equal to one. In the present paper we analyze the effects of the finite dark matter temperature on the properties of the Bose-Einstein Condensed dark matter halos. We formulate the basic equations describing the finite temperature condensate, representing a generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation that takes into account the presence of the thermal cloud. The static condensate and thermal cloud in thermodynamic equilibrium is analyzed in detail, by using the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov and Thomas-Fermi approximations. The condensed dark matter and thermal cloud density and mass profiles at finite temperatures are explicitly obtained. Our results show that when the temperature of the condensate and of the thermal cloud are much smaller than the critical Bose-Einstein transition temperature, the zero temperature density and mass profiles give an excellent description of the dark matter halos. However, finite temperature effects may play an important role in the early stages of the cosmological evolution of the dark matter condensates.",

    "summary": "We study the mechanisms of the gravitational collapse of the Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter halos, described by the zero temperature time-dependent nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (the Gross-Pitaevskii equation), with repulsive inter-particle interactions. By using a variational approach, and by choosing an appropriate trial wave function, we reformulate the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with spherical symmetry as Newton's equation of motion for a particle in an effective potential, which is determined by the zero point kinetic energy, the gravitational energy, and the particles interaction energy, respectively. The velocity of the condensate is proportional to the radial distance, with a time dependent proportionality function. The equation of motion of the collapsing dark matter condensate is studied by using both analytical and numerical methods. The collapse of the condensate ends with the formation of a stable configuration, corresponding to the minimum of the effective potential. The radius and the mass of the resulting dark matter object are obtained, as well as the collapse time of the condensate. The numerical values of these global astrophysical quantities, characterizing condensed dark matter systems, strongly depend on the two parameters describing the condensate, the mass of the dark matter particle, and of the scattering length, respectively. The stability of the condensate under small perturbations is also studied, and the oscillations frequency of the halo is obtained. Hence these results show that the gravitational collapse of the condensed dark matter halos can lead to the formation of stable astrophysical systems with both galactic and stellar sizes.",

Such a Bose-Einstein condensate represents the most \"classical\" form of a matter wave, just as an optical laser emits the most classical form of an electromagnetic wave. Beneath this giant matter wave, however, the discrete atoms represent a crucial granularity, i.e. a quantization of this matter wave field. Here we show experimentally that this quantization together with the cold collisions between atoms lead to a series of collapses and revivals of the coherent matter wave field of a Bose-Einstein condensate. We observe such collapses and revivals directly in the dynamical evolution of a multiple matter wave interference pattern, and thereby demonstrate a striking new behaviour of macroscopic quantum matter.",

The advantage of this approach is that one does not need to make further assumptions on the derivatives of model parameters with respect to the quark current mass. The normally accepted model-independent result in nuclear matter is naturally reproduced. The change of the quark condensate induced by interactions depends on the incompressibility of nuclear matter. When it is greater than 260 MeV, the density at which the condensate vanishes is higher than that from the linear extrapolation. For the chiral condensate in quark matter, a similar model-independent linear behavior is found at lower densities, which means that the decreasing speed of the condensate in quark matter is merely half of that in nuclear matter if the pion-nucleon sigma commutator is six times the average current mass of u and d quarks. The modification due to QCD-like interactions is found to slow the decreasing speed of the condensate, compared with the linear extrapolation.",

    "title": "Evolution of cosmological perturbations in Bose-Einstein condensate dark   matter",
    "summary": "We consider the global cosmological evolution and the evolution of the density contrast in the Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter model, in the framework of a Post-Newtonian cosmological approach. In the Bose-Einstein model, dark matter can be described as a non-relativistic, Newtonian gravitational condensate, whose density and pressure are related by a barotropic equation of state. For a condensate with quartic non-linearity, the equation of state is polytropic with index $n=1$. The basic equation describing the evolution of the perturbations of the Bose-Einstein condensate is obtained, and its solution is studied by using both analytical and numerical methods. The global cosmological evolution as well as the evolution of the perturbations of the condensate dark matter shows significant differences with respect to the pressureless dark matter model, considered in the framework of standard cosmology. Therefore the presence of condensate dark matter could have modified drastically the cosmological evolution of the early universe, as well as the large scale structure formation process.",

    "title": "Cosmological evolution of finite temperature Bose-Einstein Condensate   dark matter",
    "summary": "Once the temperature of a bosonic gas is smaller than the critical, density dependent, transition temperature, a Bose - Einstein Condensation process can take place during the cosmological evolution of the Universe. Bose - Einstein Condensates are very strong candidates for dark matter, since they can solve some major issues in observational astrophysics, like, for example, the galactic core/cusp problem. The presence of the dark matter condensates also drastically affects the cosmic history of the Universe. In the present paper we analyze the effects of the finite dark matter temperature on the cosmological evolution of the Bose-Einstein Condensate dark matter systems. We formulate the basic equations describing the finite temperature condensate, representing a generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation that takes into account the presence of the thermal cloud in thermodynamic equilibrium with the condensate. The temperature dependent equations of state of the thermal cloud and of the condensate are explicitly obtained in an analytical form. By assuming a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) geometry, the cosmological evolution of the finite temperature dark matter filled Universe is considered in detail in the framework of a two interacting fluid dark matter model, describing the transition from the initial thermal cloud to the low temperature condensate state. The dynamics of the cosmological parameters during the finite temperature dominated phase of the dark matter evolution are investigated in detail, and it is shown that the presence of the thermal excitations leads to an overall increase in the expansion rate of the Universe.",

To illustrate the point, we show that an impurity atom moving in a homogeneous zero-temperature condensate is not scattered incoherently if its velocity is lower than the condensate sound velocity $c$, limiting cooling to velocities $v \\geq c$. This striking effect is an expression of superfluidity and provides a direct means to detect the fundamental property of superfluidity in atomic condensates.

Upon formation of the soliton the maximum eigenvalue of the single-particle density matrix increases dramatically, indicating that a fragmented condensate converts into a single condensate as a consequence of the breaking of translation symmetry.",

This common feature has obscured and limited their observation to a select few systems.

Specifically for parameters relating to TlCuCl$_3$, we find an energy ($\\Delta_H$) to width ($\\Gamma_H$) ratio $\\Delta_H/\\Gamma_H\\sim500$, making this the narrowest predicted Higgs mode in a condensed matter system, some two orders of magnitude `narrower' than the sharpest condensed matter Higgs observed so far.",

    "summary": "The phase diagram of dense quark matter with chiral imbalance is considered with the conditions of electric neutrality and $\\beta$-equilibrium. It has been shown recently that chiral imbalance can generate charged pion condensation in dense quark matter, so it was interesting to verify that this phenomenon takes place in realistic physical scenarios such as electrically neutral matter in $\\beta$-equilibrium, because a window of pion condensation at dense quark matter phase diagram (without chiral imbalance) predicted earlier was closed by the consideration of these conditions at the physical current quark mass. In this paper it has been shown that the charged pion condensation is generated by chiral imbalance in the dense electric neutral quark/baryonic matter in $\\beta$-equilibrium, i. e. matter in neutron stars. It has been also demonstrated that pion condensation is inevitable phenomenon in dense quark matter with chiral imbalance if there is non-zero chiral imbalance in two forms, chiral and chiral isospin one. It seems that in this case pion condensation phase can be hardly avoided by any physical constraint on isopin imbalance and that this conclusion can be probably generalized from neutron star matter to the matter produced in heavy ion collisions or in neutron star mergers. The chiral limit and the physical piont (physical pion mass) has been considered and it was shown that the appearance of pion condensation is not much affected by the consideration of non-zero current quark mass.",

This loss of memory of the initial conditions allows a simple and complete description of the stationary dynamics of the condensate which randomly visits symmetric and symmetry-breaking states.",

    "summary": "We investigate the possibility of kaon condensation in the dense interior of neutron stars through the s--wave interaction of kaons with nucleons. We include nucleon--nucleon interactions by using simple parametrizations of realistic forces, and include electrons and muons in $\\beta$--equilibrium. The conditions under which kaon condensed cores undergo a transition to quark matter containing strange quarks are also established. The critical density for kaon condensation lies in the range (2.3--5.0)$~\\rho_0$, where $\\rho_0=0.16$~fm$^{-3}$ is the equilibrium density of nuclear matter. For too large a value of the strangeness content of the proton, matter with a kaon condensate is not sufficiently stiff to support the lower limit of $1.44 M_\\odot$ for a neutron star. Kaon condensation dramatically increases the proton abundance of matter and even allows positrons to exist inside the core. We also consider the case when neutrinos are trapped in the matter. Neutrino trapping shifts both kaon condensation and the quark matter transition to higher densities than in the case of cold, catalyzed matter. A newly--formed neutron star is expected to have a rather low central density, the density rising only after mass accretion onto the star ends after a few seconds. Thus, it is likely that if kaon condensation and/or the quark--hadron phase transition occur, they do so only during or after the mass accretion and neutrino trapping stages. We suggest that neutrino observations from a galactic supernova may provide direct evidence for or against a condensate and/or a quark--hadron transition.",

    "summary": "We study the gravitational effect of non-self-annihilating dark matter on compact stellar objects. The self-interaction of condensate dark matter can give high accretion rate of dark matter onto stars. Phase transition to condensation state takes place when the dark matter density exceeds the critical value. A compact degenerate dark matter core is developed and alter the structure and stability of the stellar objects. Condensate dark matter admixed neutron stars is studied through the two-fuid TOV equation. The existence of condensate dark matter deforms the mass-radius relation of neutron stars and lower their maximum baryonic masses and radii. The possible effects on the Gamma-ray Burst rate in high redshift are discussed.",

    "summary": "Mirror matter type dark matter can exist on the Earth's surface, potentially in enhanced concentrations at various anomalous impact sites. Mirror matter fragments can draw in heat from the ordinary matter environment, radiate mirror photons and thereby cool the surrounding ordinary matter. We quantify this effect and suggest that it could be used to help locate mirror matter deposits. This method, together with the centrifuge technique, seems to provide the most promising means to experimentally detect mirror matter type dark matter in the Earth.",

The dark matter sector is supposed to be of Bose-Einstein condensate type. The Bose-Einstein condensation process in a cosmological context by supposing it as an approximate first order phase transition, has been already studied in the literature. Here, we study the evolution of the physical quantities related to the early universe description such as the energy density, temperature and scale factor of the universe, before, during and after the condensation process. We also consider in detail the evolution era of the universe in a mixed normal-condensate dark matter phase. The behavior and time evolution of the condensate dark matter fraction is also analyzed.",
