To explore characteristic phenomena in these states, we calculate and predict the superconducting piezoelectric effect and superconducting diode effect.

    "summary": "The complete scenario of high-Tc superconductivity based on experimental data from electron-tunneling spectroscopy on underdoped, overdoped and Ni-doped Bi2212 single crystals using a break-junction technique is presented. There are two different types of superconductivity in cuprates: superconductivity due to pairing of spinons on charged stripes and magnetic superconductivity mediated by spin-waves. The coherent state of the spinon superconductivity is established via the magnetic superconductivity. In NCCO, there is only the spinon superconductivity and the coherent state is established due to the Josephson coupling between charged stripes. Below Tc, we observe four different gaps, namely, (i) a SDW gap due to antiferromagnetic correlations; (ii) a superconducting gap due to spinon pairing; (iii) a d-wave magnetic superconducting gap, and (iv) a small superconducting gap most likely having g-wave symmetry. We show that the d-wave superconductivity is mediated by spin-waves and the magnitude of the superconducting gap due to pairing of spinons is larger than the magnitude of the d-wave gap, however, the d-wave gap is more intense. The superconducting gap due to pairing of spinons most likely has a s-wave symmetry. The maximum magnitudes of the SDW, the spinon and d-wave gaps are located at (p/2, p/2), (p/2, p/2) and (p, 0) on the Fermi surface, respectively. The d-g-wave superconductivity mediated by spin-waves can be considered as a pairing of magnetic polarons. We formulate a theorem for cuprates by analogy with the Anderson's theorem for classical superconductors. The presented model of high-Tc superconductivity naturally explains other experimental data.",

The discovery of superconductivity in a single crystal of $UGe_2$, $ZrZn_2$ and $URhGe$ revived the interest in the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism. The experiments indicate that: i)The superconductivity is confined to the ferromagnetic phase. ii)The ferromagnetic order is stable within the superconducting phase (neutron scattering experiments). iii) The specific heat anomaly associated with the superconductivity in these materials appears to be absent. The specific heat depends on the temperature linearly at low temperature.

    "summary": "Interfacial superconductivity is observed in a variety of heterostructures composed of different materials including superconducting and nonsuperconducting (at appropriate doping and temperatures) cuprates and iron-based pnictides. The origin of this superconductivity remains in many cases unclear. Here, we propose a general mechanism of interfacial superconductivity for systems with competing order parameters. We assume that parameters characterizing the material allow formation of another order like charge- or spin-density wave competing and prevailing superconductivity in the bulk (hidden superconductivity). Diffusive electron scattering on the interface results in a suppression of this order and releasing the superconductivity. Our theory is based on the use of Ginzburg--Landau equations applicable to a broad class of systems. We demonstrate that the local superconductivity appears in the vicinity of the interface and the spatial dependence of the superconducting order parameter~$\\Delta(x)$ is described by the Gross--Pitaevskii equation. Solving this equation we obtain quantized values of temperature and doping levels at which~$\\Delta(x)$ appears. Remarkably, the local superconductivity shows up even in the case when the rival order is only slightly suppressed and may arise also on the surface of the sample (surface superconductivity).",

The same elements are contained in Al5Nb24Ti40V5Zr26, which is a recently discovered bcc HEA and shows a gum-metal-like behavior after cold rolling. The gum metal is also an interesting system, exhibiting superelasticity and low Young's modulus. If gum metals show superconductivity and can be used as a superconducting wire, the gum-metal HEA superconductors might be the next-generation superconducting wire materials. Aiming at a fundamental assessment of as-cast Al-Nb-Ti-V-Zr multicomponent alloys including Al5Nb24Ti40V5Zr26, we have investigated the structural and superconducting properties of the alloys. All alloys investigated show the superconductivity, and the valence electron concentration dependence of the superconducting critical temperature is very close to those of typical superconducting bcc HEAs.",

Focusing on phonon-mediating superconductivity, one would propose to promote critical temperature by substituting heavy elements by lighter ones, in order to increase Debye temperature. Following recent experimental progress in transition-metal nitrides and theoretically revealing W$_2$N$_3$ as a candidate for high-temperature superconductivity, we investigate the possibility of two-dimensional superconductivity through surface engineering on MoN$_2$. Using density functional theory calculation, we found multigap superconductivity at temperature up to 36K within anisotropic Eliashberg equation in passivated electride-like surfaces. We also demonstrate their possibility to sustain topological superconductivity with strong spin-orbital coupling.",

It is known from Maxwell equations that the current creates magnetic field that suppresses superconductivity and wire starts to conduct with resistance. We consider the time dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory to resolve the problem. The solutions of the system of equations show that applied electric field, perpendicular to the axis of the wire and to the magnetic field restores superconductivity and wire starts to conduct without resistivity. We can increase the current to a new suppression of superconductivity and to restore superconductivity increasing the applied electric field. The aforementioned results permit us to conclude that the superconducting wire can transport a very strong current if the novel design discussed in the paper is applied.",

    "summary": "We have systematically investigated the annealing effect on the superconductivity of iron chalcogenide Fe1+y(Te1-xSex). The atmospheres used for annealing include O2, N2, I2 vapor, air and vacuum. We observed that annealing in O2, I2 and air could enhance superconductivity for the underdoped samples, consistent with the results reported in literatures. Interestingly, we found that annealing in N2 also leads to superconductivity enhancement, similar to the annealing effects of O2, I2 and air. However, vacuum annealing does not enhance superconductivity, which indicates that the enhanced superconductivity in O2-, N2-, I2- and air-annealed samples is not due to improved homogeneity. In addition, we have treated the underdoped samples with nitric acid, which is found to enhance superconductivity as well. Our analyses of these results support the argument that the superconductivity enhancement, caused either by annealing or nitric acid treatment, originates from the variation of interstitial Fe. The interstitial Fe, which is destructive to superconducting pairing, can be reduced by annealing in oxidation agents or nitric acid treatment. We also find that although N2-, O2- and air-annealed samples exhibit strong superconducting diamagnetism with -4pichi ~1 (chi, dc magnetic susceptibility) for some samples, their actual superconducting volume fraction probed by specific heat is low, ranging from 10% to 30% for 0.09 < x < 0.3, indicating that the superconductivity suppression remains significant even in annealed samples. The strong diamagnetism is associated with the superconducting shielding effect on the non-superconducting phase. We have also established the phase diagram of the annealed samples and compared it with that of the as-grown samples. The effect of annealing on the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity is discussed.",

    "summary": "We derive the linearized Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equation for an ultra-thin superconducting film with curvature in a magnetic field. By introducing a novel transverse order parameter that varies slowly along the film, and applying the superconducting/vacuum boundary condition, we decouple the linearized GL equation into a transverse part and a surface part that includes the superconducting geometric potential (GP). The nucleation of the superconducting state in curved thin superconducting films can be equivalently described by the surface part equation. In the equivalent GL free energy of a curved superconducting film, the superconducting GP enables the film to remain in the superconducting state even when the superconducting parameter $ \\alpha $ turns positive by further reducing the quadratic term of the order parameter. Furthermore, we numerically investigate the phase transition of a rectangle thin superconducting film bent around a cylindrical surface. Our numerical results show that the superconducting GP enhances the superconductivity of the curved film by weakening the effect of the magnetic field, and the increase of the critical temperature, in units of the bulk critical temperature, is equal to the product of the negative superconducting GP and the square of the zero-temperature coherence length, which agrees with our theoretical predictions.",

    "title": "Tip-induced Superconductivity",
    "summary": "It is widely believed that topological superconductivity, a hitherto elusive phase of quantum matter, can be achieved by inducing superconductivity in topological materials. In search of such topological superconductors, certain topological insulators (like, Bi$_2$Se$_3$) were successfully turned into superconductors by metal-ion (Cu, Pd, Sr, Nb etc. ) intercalation. Superconductivity could be induced in topological materials through applying pressure as well. for example, a pressure-induced superconducting phase was found in the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$. However, in all such cases, no conclusive signature of topological superconductivity was found. In this review, we will discuss about another novel way of inducing superconductivity in a non-superconducting topological material -- by creating a mesoscopic interface on the material with a non-superconducting, normal metallic tip where the mesoscopic interface becomes superconducting. Such a phase is now known as a tip-induced superconducting (TISC) phase. This was first seen in 2014 on Cd$_3$As$_2$ at IISER Mohali, India. Following that, a large number of other topological materials were shown to display TISC. Since the TISC phase emerges only at a confined region under a mesoscopic point contact, traditional bulk tools for characterizing superconductivity cannot be employed to detect/confirm such a phase. On the other hand, such a point contact geometry is ideal for probing the possible existence of a temperature and magnetic field dependent superconducting energy gap and a temperature and magnetic field dependent critical current. We will review the details of the experimental signatures that can be used to prove the existence of superconductivity even when the \"text-book\" tests for detecting superconductivity cannot be performed. Then, we will review different systems where a TISC phase could be realized.",

Due to isotropic superconducting properties and the lack of breaking of inversion symmetry for conventional s-wave superconductors, such a superconducting peer is absent. Recently, a series of superconducting structures, including superconducting superlattice and quantum-material-based superconducting Josephson junction, have exhibited a superconducting diode effect in terms of polarity-dependent critical current. However, due to complex structures, these composite systems are not able to construct large-scale integrated superconducting circuits. Here, we demonstrated the minimal superconducting electric component-superconducting nanowire-based diode with a nonreciprocal transport effect under a perpendicular magnetic field, in which the superconducting to normal metallic phase transition relies on the polarity and amplitude of the bias current. Our nanowire diodes can be reliably operated nearly at all temperatures below the critical temperature, and the rectification efficiency at 2 K can be more than 24%. Moreover, the superconducting nanowire diode is able to rectify both square wave and sine wave signals without any distortion. Combining the superconducting nanowire-based diodes and transistors, superconducting nanowires hold the possibility to construct novel low-dissipation superconducting ICs.",

The mechanisms of conventional, half-conventional and unconventional superconductivity are discussed in the following chapters. The last three chapters of the book are devoted to room temperature superconductivity. In Chapter 2, an attempt to review the basic properties of the superconducting state independently of any specific mechanism is made for the first time. In addition, four principles of superconductivity valid for any type of superconductivity are introduced in Chapter 4. The book is mainly addressed to specialists in materials science and in the field of superconductivity.

    "summary": "SrTiO$_3$ is a unique example of a system which exhibits both quantum paraelectricity and superconductivity. Thus, it is expected that the superconducting state is closely related to the intrinsic ferroelectric instability. Indeed, recent experiments suggest existence of a coexistent phase of superconductivity and ferroelectricity in Ca-substituted SrTiO$_3$. In this paper, we propose that SrTiO$_3$ can be a platform of the ferroelectric superconductivity, which is characterized by a ferroelectric transition in the superconducting state. By analyzing a multiorbital model for $t_{2g}$ electrons, we show that the ferroelectric superconductivity is stabilized through two different mechanisms which rely on the presence of the spin-orbit coupling. First, the ferroelectric superconducting state is stabilized in the dilute carrier density regime due to a ferroelectricity-induced Lifshitz transition. Second, it is stabilized under a magnetic field independent of the carrier density. The importance of the multiorbital or multiband nature for the ferroelectric superconductivity is clarified. Then, we predict a topological Weyl superconducting state in the ferroelectric superconducting phase of SrTiO$_3$.",

    "title": "Tuning stoichiometry and its impact on superconductivity of monolayer   and multilayer FeSe on SrTiO3",
    "summary": "Synthesis of monolayer FeSe on SrTiO3, with greatly enhanced superconductivity compared to bulk FeSe, remains difficult. Lengthy annealing within a certain temperature window is always required to achieve superconducting samples as reported by different groups around the world, but the mechanism of annealing in inducing superconductivity has not been elucidated. We grow FeSe films on SrTiO3 by molecular beam epitaxy and adjust the stoichiometry by depositing additional small amounts of Fe atoms. The monolayer films become superconducting after the Fe deposition without any annealing, and show similar superconducting transition temperatures as those of the annealed films in transport measurements. We also demonstrate on the 5-unit-cell films that the FeSe multilayer can be reversibly tuned between the non-superconducting $\\sqrt{5} \\times \\sqrt{5}$ phase with Fe-vacancies and superconducting $1 \\times 1$ phase. Our results reveal that the traditional anneal process in essence removes Fe vacancies and the additional Fe deposition serves as a more efficient way to achieve superconductivity. This work highlights the significance of stoichiometry in the superconductivity of FeSe thin films and provides an easy path for superconducting samples.",

    "summary": "Recently, unconventional superconductivity having a zero-bias conductance peak is reported in doped topological Dirac semimetal (DSM) with lattice distortion. Motivated by the experiments, we theoretically study the possible symmetry-lowering lattice distortions and their effects on the emergence of unconventional superconductivity in doped topological DSM. We find four types of symmetry-lowering lattice distortions that reproduce the crystal symmetries relevant to experiments from the group-theoretical analysis. Considering inter-orbital and intra-orbital electron density-density interactions, we calculate superconducting phase diagrams. We find that the lattice distortions can induce unconventional superconductivity hosting gapless surface Andreev bound states (SABS). Depending on the lattice distortions and superconducting pairing interactions, the unconventional inversion-odd-parity superconductivity can be either topological nodal superconductivity hosting a flat SABS or topological crystalline superconductivity hosting a gapless SABS. Remarkably, the lattice distortions increase the superconducting critical temperature, which is consistent with the experiments. Our work opens a pathway to explore and control pressure-induced topological superconductivity in doped topological semimetals.",

Next, we will cover the latest advances on experimental studies of ferroelectricity-tuned superconductivity based on different 2D materials or van der Waals heterostructures. Finally, as perspectives, we will outline schemes that may allow to materialize new types of 2D systems that simultaneously harbor ferroelectricity and superconductivity, or that may lead to enhanced ferroelectric superconductivity, ferroelectric topological superconductivity, and new types of superconducting devices such as superconducting diodes.",

Here, we integrated the high-precision angle-resolved resistivity (ARR) measurement with a rotatable in-plane magnetic field to systematically study the angular dependence of superconducting fluctuations in optimally doped La1.84Sr0.16CuO4 (LSCO). By independently controlling the directions of the current and the magnetic field, we are able to isolate the magneto-resistivity contributed by the superconducting vortex motion and distinguish excitations from nematic superconductivity and d-wave superconductive order based on their respective C2 and C4 symmetries. Signatures of two intertwined superconductive orders are also evident in the measured angular dependence of the critical current. A T-B phase diagram of different types of superconducting fluctuations is determined. These findings are closely related to other intriguing phenomena, such as pair density wave and charge density wave.",

    "title": "Physical Mechanism of Superconductivity",
    "summary": "The physical mechanism of superconductivity is proposed on the basis of carrier-induced dynamic strain effect. By this new model, superconducting state consists of the dynamic bound state of superconducting electrons, which is formed by the high-energy nonbonding electrons through dynamic interaction with their surrounding lattice to trap themselves into the three - dimensional potential wells lying in energy at above the Fermi level of the material. The binding energy of superconducting electrons dominates the superconducting transition temperature in the corresponding material. Under an electric field, superconducting electrons move coherently with lattice distortion wave and periodically exchange their excitation energy with chain lattice, that is, the superconducting electrons transfer periodically between their dynamic bound state and conducting state. Thus, the intrinsic feature of superconductivity is to generate an oscillating current under a dc voltage. The coherence lengths in cuprates must have the value equal to an even number times the lattice constant. A superconducting material must simultaneously satisfy three criteria required by superconductivity. Almost all of the puzzling behavior of the cuprates can be uniquely understood under this new model. We demonstrate that the factor 2 in Josephson current equation, in fact, is resulting from 2V, the voltage drops across the two superconductor sections on both sides of a junction, not from the Cooper pair, and the magnetic flux is quantized in units of h/e, postulated by London, not in units of h/2e. The central features of superconductivity, such as Josephson effect, the tunneling mechanism in multijunction systems, and the origin of the superconducting tunneling phenomena, are all physically reconsidered under this superconductivity model.",

Of particular interest has been the fact that this structure type provides an excellent structural framework for the existence of superconductivity. The high Tc copper oxides are the most famous examples of superconducting perovskites, but there are many others [1]. Intermetallic compounds have been the source of many superconducting materials in the past, but they have been eclipsed in recent years by the perovskite oxides. The recent discovery of superconductivity in MgB2 [2] suggests that intermetallic compounds with simple structure types are worth serious reconsideration as sources of new superconducting materials. Here we report the observation of superconductivity at 8 K in the perovskite structure intermetallic compound MgCNi3, linking what appear at first sight to be mutually exclusive classes of superconducting materials. The observation of superconductivity in MgCNi3 indicates that MgB2 will not be the only one of its kind within the chemical paradigm that it suggests for new superconducting materials.",

The competition between Anderson localization and s-wave superconductivity is investigated from the microscopic point of view. The effect of microscopic inhomogeneity and the thermal fluctuation in superconductivity are taken into account using the self-consistent 1-loop-order theory with respect to superconducting fluctuation. The crossover from superconductivity in the host band to that in the impurity band is described on the basis of the disordered three-dimensional attractive Hubbard model for binary alloys. We show that superconductor-insulator transition (SIT) accompanies the crossover. We point out an enhancement of Cooper pairing in the crossover regime. Further localization of the electron wave function gives rise to incoherent Cooper pairs and the pseudogap above T_c. A global phase diagram is drawn for host band superconductivity, impurity band superconductivity, Anderson localization, Fermi liquid state, and pseudogap state. A theoretical interpretation is proposed for superconductivity in the doped diamond, SiC, and Si.",

    "summary": "Thin superconducting films form a unique platform for geometrically-confined, strongly-interacting electrons. They allow an inherent competition between disorder and superconductivity, which in turn enables the intriguing superconducting-to-insulator transition and believed to facilitate the comprehension of high-Tc superconductivity. Furthermore, understanding thin film superconductivity is technologically essential e.g. for photo-detectors, and quantum-computers. Consequently, the absence of an established universal relationships between critical temperature ($T_c$), film thickness ($d$) and sheet resistance ($R_s$) hinders both our understanding of the onset of the superconductivity and the development of miniaturised superconducting devices. We report that in thin films, superconductivity scales as $d^.$$T_c(R_s)$. We demonstrated this scaling by analysing the data published over the past 46 years for different materials (and facilitated this database for further analysis). Moreover, we experimentally confirmed the discovered scaling for NbN films, quantified it with a power law, explored its possible origin and demonstrated its usefulness for superconducting film-based devices.",

Whatever the mother normal states are the superconductivity is {\\em normal} with BCS-like behaviours of the paired quasiparticles in condensation. To reconcile the diverse mother normal states and the normal superconductivity in unconventional superconductors, we revisit a proposal that the emergence of the low-energy coherent parts of the physical electrons, which survive from the interaction correlations, is an essential prerequisite for superconductivity. The superconductivity is driven by the pair condensation of these coherent parts of the physical electrons. Moreover the incoherent parts of the physical electrons can enhance the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ although they are not in driving role in the emergence of the superconductivity. Some experimental responses of the coherent parts of the physical electrons are predicted.",

Superconductivity was induced by donor molecules on non-superconducting FeSe layer, while the superconductivity was suppressed near acceptor molecules.

Indeed, the local suppression of superconductivity by photon absorption may trigger vortex nucleation and motion effects, which can make the superconducting state unstable. In addition, scaling down the thickness of the superconducting films and/or the width of the bridge geometry can strongly influence the transport properties of superconducting films, e.g. affecting its critical current as well as its switching current into the normal state. Understanding such instability can boost the performances of those superconducting devices based on nanowire geometries. We present an experimental study on the resistive switching in NbN and NbTiN ultra-thin films with a thickness of few nanometers. Despite both films were patterned with the same microbridge geometry, the two superconducting materials show different behaviors at very low applied magnetic fields. A comparison with other low temperature superconducting materials outlines the influence of geometry effects on the superconducting transport properties of these materials particularly useful for devices applications.",

    "title": "Exotic Superconducting States in FeSe-based Materials",
    "summary": "High-temperature superconductivity and a wide variety of exotic superconducting states discovered in FeSe-based materials have been at the frontier of research on condensed matter physics over the past decade. Unique properties originating from the multiband electronic structure, strongly orbital-dependent phenomena, extremely small Fermi energy, electronic nematicity, and topological aspects give rise to many distinct and fascinating superconducting states. Here, we provide an overview of our current understanding of the superconductivity of {\\it bulk} FeSe-based materials, focusing on FeSe and the isovalent substituted FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$ and FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$. We discuss the highly nontrivial superconducting properties in FeSe, including extremely anisotropic pairing states, crossover phenomena from Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer (BCS) to Bose--Einstein condensation (BEC) states, a novel field-induced superconducting phase, and broken time-reversal symmetry. We also discuss the evolution of the superconducting gap function with sulfur and tellurium doping, paying particular attention to the impact of quantum critical nematic fluctuations and the topological superconductivity. FeSe-based materials provide an excellent playground to study various exotic superconducting states.",

    "summary": "The transition from normal state to superconductive state is a condensation (Bose-Einstein condensation) process. As an example of Bose-Einstein condensation, the condensation process of superconductivity is investigated in detail. The basic unit of superconductivity is condensation circuit, which should contain 4m+2 (m=1,2,...) electrons (holes). The perfect explanation for no resistance and complete diamagnetism are given by using condensation circuit. The quantum mechanics equation of superconductive state is constructed, and energy level equation of superconductive quantum state is given. The later equation has simple form (I is the unit matrix, A is the adjacent matrix), with deep topological meanings. The phase transition from normal state to superconductive state is irreversible. The irreversible process is analyzed and discussed in detail. The temperature region of superconductive state is calculated. The simplest structure of superconductor circuit is a condensation circuit which is composed of a series of 3-4-element-circuits (called lantern series structure). It is theoretically proved that the room temperature superconductivity can be realized by using polylayer oxide structure. The experimental frame of room temperature superconductivity is suggested.",

    "summary": "The recent observation of superconductivity at the interfaces between KTaO3 and EuO (or LaAlO3) offers a new example of emergent phenomena at oxide interfaces. This superconductivity exhibits an unusual strong dependence on the crystalline orientation of KTaO3 and its superconducting transition temperature Tc is nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of the seminal LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface. To understand its mechanism, it is crucial to address if the formation of oxide interfaces is indispensable for the presence of superconductivity. Here, by exploiting ionic liquid (IL) gating, we obtain superconductivity at KTaO3 (111) and (110) surfaces with Tc up to 2.0 K and 1.0 K, respectively. This oxide-interface-free superconductivity gives a clear experimental evidence that the essential physics of KTaO3 interface superconductivity lies in the KTaO3 surfaces doped with electrons. Moreover, the ability to control superconductivity at surfaces with IL provides a simple way to study the intrinsic superconductivity in KTaO3.",

    "summary": "Since the discovery of superconductivity in the Fe(Te,Se) system, it has been a general consensus that the end member of FeTe is not superconducting. Nonetheless, in recent years, there have been reports of superconducting FeTe films, but the origin of their superconductivity remains mysterious. Here, we provide the first comprehensive review of all the reported FeTe films regarding the relationship between their superconductivity and neighboring layers. Based on this review, we show that telluride neighboring layers are the key to superconducting FeTe films. Then, with additional new studies, we show that stoichiometric Te content, which can be readily achieved in FeTe films with the assistance of neighboring telluride layers, might be crucial to stabilizing the superconductivity in this system. This work provides insights into the underlying mechanism behind superconductivity in FeTe films and sheds light on the critical role of neighboring layers and stoichiometry control toward manipulating topological superconductivity in FeTe heterostructures.",

    "summary": "There are several strategies to discover new superconductors. Growing new materials and applying high pressures can be the classic ways since superconductivity was found. Also, chemical processing, such as annealing, is another way to induce superconductivity in a non-superconducting material. Here, we show chemical processing effects in the non-superconducting material, sulfur-substituted FeTe. It has been known that superconductivity in S-substituted FeTe is induced by O$_2$ annealing. We revealed that hydrochloric acid etching and vacuum annealing for O$_2$-annealed samples made the quality of superconductivity higher by several physical property measurements. Furthermore, we visualized the superconducting regions by a magneto-optical imaging technique, indicating that the superconductivity in the processed sample was bulk. In this sample, we confirmed that the concentration of excess iron was reduced compared to that in the as-grown state. These results provide an important route to bulk superconductivity in S-substituted FeTe and its related iron-based compounds.",

    "title": "Controllable manipulation of superconductivity using magnetic vortices",
    "summary": "The magneto-transport of a superconducting/ferromagnetic hybrid structure consisting of a superconducting thin film in contact with an array of magnetic nanodots in the so-called \"magnetic vortex-state\" exhibits interesting properties. For certain magnetic states, the stray magnetic field from the vortex array is intense enough to drive the superconducting film into the normal state. In this fashion, the normal-to-superconducting phase transition can be controlled by the magnetic history. The strong coupling between superconducting and magnetic subsystems allows characteristically ferromagnetic properties, such as hysteresis and remanence, to be dramatically transferred into the transport properties of the superconductor.",

    "title": "Suppression of superconductivity at nematic critical point in underdoped   cuprates",
    "summary": "A nematic quantum critical point is anticipated to exist in the superconducting dome of some high-temperature superconductors. The nematic order competes with the superconducting order and hence reduces the superconducting condensate at $T = 0$. Moreover, the critical fluctuations of nematic order can excite more nodal quasiparticles out of the condensate. We address these two effects within an effective field theory and show that superfluid density $\\rho^s(T)$ and superconducting temperature $T_c$ are both suppressed strongly by the critical fluctuations. The strong suppression of superconductivity provides a possible way to determine the nematic quantum critical point.",
