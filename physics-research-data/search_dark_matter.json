    "summary": "Scalar fields appear in many cosmological models, in particular in order to provide explanations for dark energy and inflation, but also to emulate dark matter. In this paper, we show that it is possible for a scalar field to replace simultaneously dark matter, dark energy and inflation by assuming the existence of a non-minimal coupling to gravity, a Mexican hat potential, and a spontaneous symmetry breaking before inflation. After inflation, the scalar field behaves like a dark fluid, mimicking dark energy and dark matter, and has a dark matter behaviour similar to fuzzy dark matter.",

    "title": "Attenuation of Boosted Dark Matter in Two Component Dark Matter Scenario",
    "summary": "Boosted dark matter constitutes a small fraction of the total dark matter in the Universe, with mass ranging from eV to MeV and often exhibiting (semi)relativistic velocity. Hence the likelihood of detecting boosted dark matter in Earth-based direct detection experiments is relatively high. There is more than one explanation for the origin of the boosted dark matter including the two-component dark matter models where the heavier dark matter species(dominant) annihilates to nearly monoenergetic light dark matter particles (subdominant) in the galactic halo. If the dominant dark matter species is heavier (MeV-GeV), the subdominant light dark matter achieves (semi)relativistic velocity or {\\it boost}. These boosted dark matter particles suffer from scattering with electrons and nuclei while crossing the atmosphere and the Earth's crust before reaching underground experiments and hence the kinetic energy of the dark matter is attenuated. In the two-component dark matter framework, we examine how the boost of the dark matter influences the attenuation of kinetic energy across a broad spectrum of dark matter masses. We perform a detailed study at various DM-electron and DM-nucleus cross sections including the effect of nuclear form factor and elastic and inelastic scattering (for large kinetic energy). For a 10 MeV boosted dark matter with boost $\\sim$ 10-100, the effect of DM-electron scattering is found to be severe than the DM-nucleus scattering (with form factor) if DM-nucleon scattering cross section is $10^{-29}$cm$^2$. We also show how the peak position of the boosted dark matter flux shifts due to the attenuation of its kinetic energy.",

The right-handed neutrinos couple both to the Standard Model and to a hidden sector where the dark matter resides. This framework explains the lepton asymmetry, dark matter abundance and neutrino masses all at once. In contrast to previous realizations of asymmetric dark matter, the model allows for a wide range of dark matter masses, from keV to 10 TeV. In particular, very light dark matter can be accommodated without violating experimental constraints. We discuss several variants of our model that highlight interesting phenomenological possibilities. In one, late decays repopulate the symmetric dark matter component, providing a new mechanism for generating a large annihilation rate at the present epoch and allowing for mixed warm/cold dark matter. In a second scenario, dark matter mixes with the active neutrinos, thus presenting a distinct method to populate sterile neutrino dark matter through leptogenesis. At late times, oscillations and dark matter decays lead to interesting indirect detection signals.",

The spontaneous scalarization in the scalar-tensor gravity has been proposed for neutron stars. Here, we investigate the spontaneous scalarization in dark matter admixed neutron stars. Applying the dark matter equations of state, we calculate the structure of scalarized neutron stars containing dark matter. The dark matter equations of state are based on observational data from the rotational curves of galaxies and the fermionic self-interacting dark matter. Our results verify that the spontaneous scalarization is affected by the dark matter pressure in neutron stars. Depending on the central density of scalarized dark matter admixed neutron stars, the dark matter pressure alters the central scalar field. The increase of dark matter pressure in low-density scalarized stars amplifies the central scalar field. However, the pressure of dark matter in high-density scalarized stars suppresses the central scalar field. Our calculations confirm that the stars in the merger event GW170817 and in the low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1820-30 can be scalarized dark matter admixed neutron stars.",

    "summary": "If dark matter is ultralight, the number density of dark matter is very high and the techniques of zero-temperature field theory are no longer valid. The dark matter number density modifies the vacuum giving it a non-negligible particle occupation number. For fermionic dark matter, this occupation number can be no larger than one. However, in the case of bosons the occupation number is unbounded. If there is a large occupation number, the Bose enhancement needs to be taken into consideration for any process involving particles which interact with the dark matter. Because the occupation number scales inversely with the dark matter mass, this effect is most prominent for ultralight dark matter. In fact, the Bose enhancement effect from the background is so significant for ultralight dark matter that, if dark matter is a dark photon, the correction to the anomalous magnetic moment is larger than experimental uncertainties for a mixing parameter of order $10^{-16}$ and a dark photon mass of order $10^{-20}$ eV. Furthermore, the constraint on the mixing parameter scales linearly with the dark photon mass and so new significant constraints can be placed on the dark matter mass all the way up to $10^{-14}$ eV. Future experiments measuring $g-2$ will probe even smaller gauge mixing parameters.",

Assuming the dark quark mass $m$ is smaller than the dynamical scale $\\Lambda_d \\sim 4\\pi f_d$, the main component of the dark matter is the lightest $G$-parity odd dark pion associated with chiral symmetry breaking in the dark sector. We show that nonzero dark quark mass induces the universal mass contribution to both $G$-parity odd and even pions, and their masses tend to be degenerate. As a result, dark pion annihilation into heavier $G$-parity even dark pion also affects the dark matter relic abundance. Thus, our setup naturally accommodates forbidden dark matter scenario and realizes heavy dark matter whose mass is ${\\cal O}(1$-$100)~{\\rm TeV}$, which is different from conventional electroweakly interacting dark matter such as minimal dark matter. We also discuss CP-violation from $\\theta$-term in the dark gauge sector and find that the predicted size of electron electric dipole moment can be as large as $\\sim 10^{-32}~e~{\\rm cm}$.",

Composite asymmetric dark matter with dark photon portal is a promising framework explaining the coincidence problem between dark matter and visible matter. Dark strong dynamics provides rich structure in the dark sector: the lightest dark nucleon is the dark matter, while strong annihilation into dark pions depletes the symmetric components of the dark matter. Dark photons alleviate cosmological problems. Meanwhile, dark photons make dark hadrons long-lived in terrestrial experiments. Moreover, the dark hadrons are produced through the very same dark photon. In this study, we discuss the visible decay searches for composite asymmetric dark matter models. For a few GeV dark nucleons, the LHC lifetime frontier, MATHUSLA and FASER, has a potential to discover their decay when kinetic mixing angle of dark photon is $\\epsilon \\gtrsim 10^{-4}$. On the other hand, fixed-target experiments, in particular SeaQuest, will have a great sensitivity to dark pions with a mass below GeV and with kinetic mixing $\\epsilon \\gtrsim 10^{-4}$ in addition to the LHC lifetime frontier. These projected sensitivities to dark hadrons in dark photon parameter space are comparable with the future sensitivities of dark photon searches, such as Belle-II and LHCb.",

In this article, we consider dark matter as another possible constituent in hyperon stars' interior to loose this mass constrain. We take dark matter as self-interacting Fermi gas with certain repulsive interaction among the dark matter particles and non-interaction between dark matter and ordinary matter as is generally assumed. We find that the star maximum mass is sensitive to the particle mass of dark matter, and a high enough star mass larger than 2 $M_{\\odot}$ could be achieved when the particle mass is small enough. In this particular model, a strong upper limit 0.64 GeV for dark matter mass is obtained in strongly-interacting dark matter and 0.16 GeV for dark matter mass in weakly-interacting dark matter. Dark matter accumulated around the star could also contribute to the mass measurement, however, such contribution could be safely ignored when the generally used dark matter density is assumed.",

    "title": "Electroweak Symmetric Dark Matter Balls",
    "summary": "In the simple Higgs-portal dark matter model with a conserved dark matter number, we show that there exists a non-topological soliton state of dark matter. This state has smaller energy per dark matter number than a free particle state and has its interior in the electroweak symmetric vacuum. It could be produced in the early universe from first-order electroweak phase transition and contribute most of dark matter. This electroweak symmetric dark matter ball is a novel macroscopic dark matter candidate with an energy density of the electroweak scale and a mass of 1 gram or above. Because of its electroweak-symmetric interior, the dark matter ball has a large geometric scattering cross section off a nucleon or a nucleus. Dark matter and neutrino experiments with a large-size detector like Xenon1T, BOREXINO and JUNO have great potential to discover electroweak symmetric dark matter balls. We also discuss the formation of bound states of a dark matter ball and ordinary matter.",

    "title": "Dark Matter and Gravity Waves from a Dark Big Bang",
    "summary": "The Hot Big Bang is often considered as the origin of all matter and radiation in the Universe. Primordial nucleosynthesis (BBN) provides strong evidence that the early Universe contained a hot plasma of photons and baryons with a temperature $T>\\text{MeV}$. However, the earliest probes of dark matter originate from much later times around the epoch of structure formation. In this work we describe a scenario in which dark matter (and possibly dark radiation) can be formed around or even after BBN in a second Big Bang which we dub the ``Dark Big Bang''. The latter occurs through a phase transition in the dark sector which transforms dark vacuum energy into a hot dark plasma of particles; in this paper we focus on a first-order phase transition for the Dark Big Bang. The correct dark matter abundance can be set by dark matter cannibalism or by pair-annihilation within the dark sector followed by a thermal freeze-out. Alternatively ultra-heavy ``dark-zilla'' dark matter can originate directly from bubble collisions during the Dark Big Bang. We will show that the Dark Big Bang is consistent with constraints from structure formation and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) if it occurred when the Universe was less than one month old, corresponding to a temperature in the visible sector above $\\mathcal{O}$(keV). While the dark matter evades direct and indirect detection, the Dark Big Bang gives rise to striking gravity wave signatures to be tested at pulsar timing array experiments. Furthermore, the Dark Big Bang allows for realizations of self-interacting and/or warm dark matter which suggest exciting discovery potential in future small-scale structure observations.",

    "summary": "(Shortened) Weakly Interacting Massive Particles are often said to be the best Dark Matter candidates. Studies have shown however that rather large Dark Matter-photon or Dark Matter-baryon interactions could be allowed by cosmology. Here we address the question of the role of the Dark Matter interactions in more detail to determine at which extent Dark Matter has to be necessarily weakly interacting. To this purpose, we compute the collisional damping (and free-streaming) lengths of generic interacting Dark Matter candidates and compare them to the scale of the smallest primordial structures known to exist in the Universe. We obtain necessary conditions that any candidate must satisfy. We point out the existence of new Dark Matter scenarios and exhibit new damping regimes. For example, an interacting candidate may bear a similar damping than that of collisionless Warm Dark Matter particles. The main difference is due to the Dark Matter coupling to interacting (or even freely-propagating) species. Our approach yields a general classification of Dark Matter candidates which extends the definitions of the usual Cold, Warm and Hot Dark Matter scenarios when interactions, weak or strong, are considered.",

Here we use high-resolution numerical simulations to demonstrate long-term angular momentum transfer between stellar bars and dark matter orbits of varying orientation. We show that bar-driven reversals of dark matter orbit orientations can play a surprisingly large role in the evolution of the bar pattern speed.   In predominantly prograde (co-rotating) halos, dark matter orbits become trapped in the stellar bar forming a parallel dark matter bar. This dark matter bar reaches more than double the vertical height of the stellar bar. In halos dominated by retrograde orbits, a dark matter wake forms oriented perpendicular to the stellar bar. These dark matter over-densities provide a novel space to look for dark matter annihilation or decay signals. % We predict that the Milky Way hosts a dark matter bar aligned with the stellar bar as well as a dark matter wake the near-side of which should extend from Galactic center to a galactic longitude of $l \\approx 323^\\circ$.",

This boosted dark matter flux can reach kinetic energies up to tens of MeV, while the typical kinetic energies of GeV mass dark matter particles in the Milky Way halo are of the order of keV. Dark matter boosted by energetic diffuse supernova background neutrinos can be detected only through nuclear or electron scattering in ground-based detectors requiring a non-zero interaction of dark matter with nucleon or electron, in addition to its interaction with neutrino. However, in the presence of dark matter-nucleon (electron) interaction, the scattering of dark matter with cosmic rays is unavoidable. Thus, we consider boosted dark matter resulting from diffuse supernova neutrinos as well as cosmic protons (electrons) considering both energy-dependent and energy-independent scattering cross-sections between dark matter and standard model particles.

    "summary": "We discuss the relic density of asymmetric dark matter with long-range interactions in non-standard cosmological scenarios where the extra cosmic energy is introduced. The Hubble expansion rate is modified in non-standard cosmological models, which affects the relic density of dark matter. If the mass of the dark exchanged gauge boson is less than the mass of dark matter particles multiplied by the dark fine-structure constant, the wave function of the incoming particles of dark matter annihilation would be distorted away from the free plane-wave approximation, yielding the significant enhancements to annihilation cross sections, known as Sommerfeld enhancement. Sommerfeld enhancement results the asymmetric dark matter relic density under abundant, while the enhanced cosmic expansion rate increases the relic density of asymmetric dark matter by letting the decoupling from the thermal equilibrium occurs earlier. However, the mixed effect of modified cosmic expansion and the Sommerfeld enhancement on asymmetric dark matter density evolution becomes quite complicated, due to their opposing affects on relic density and contrary strength developments as the temperature fell. We investigated the mixed effects on asymmetric dark matter freeze-out process and current relic abundance, which is significantly different from the standard situation. Further, we calculate the constraint relations of the asymmetric dark matter pertubative annihilation cross section and dark coupling constant with the mass of asymmetric dark matter, the asymmetry factor with the dark coupling constant, when the relic density of asymmetric dark matter falled in the observed region. The upper bounds on the mass of asymmetric dark matter for s-wave and p-wave annihilations are also derived.",

Here, we extend dark matter models containing a Dark Sink to sub-MeV masses. We consider a Dark Sink model where the dark matter is charged under a light dark photon that has kinetic mixing with the Standard Model. For sub-MeV dark matter masses, plasmon decays are the dominant mechanism for transferring energy to the dark sector. Relative to a standard freeze-in cosmology, reproducing the observed dark matter density in a Dark Sink structure requires an increase in the dark matter couplings to the Standard Model, and hence increased direct detection cross sections. These models provide benchmarks for current and upcoming direct detection experiments. Accounting for plasmon effects, we derive the range of possible dark matter masses and cross sections for Dark Sink models in the sub-MeV regime. We make code available to reproduce our benchmarks; it may be of use for other freeze-in scenarios, including those where plasmon decays to the dark matter are important.",

A light vector dark matter particle associated with the dark $U(1)_D$ may decay and annihilate to electron-positron pairs. The produced positrons may in turn form positroniums that subsequently annihilate to two photons, accounting for the observed line signal of the Galactic 511 keV $\\gamma$-ray emission. Three scenarios are investigated. First, we consider the minimal $U(1)_D$ extension where a dark gauge boson and a dark Higgs boson are newly introduced to the particle content. As a second scenario, we consider WIMP-type dark matter with the introduction of an extra dark fermion which, in addition to the dark gauge boson, may contribute to the dark matter relic abundance. It is thus a multi-component dark matter scenario with a UV-complete dark $U(1)_D$ symmetry. In particular, the vector dark matter may account for a small fraction of the total dark matter relic abundance. Finally, we consider the scenario where the dark matter particles are of the FIMP-type. In this case, both the light vector and fermion dark matter particles may be produced via the freeze-in and super-WIMP mechanisms. Considering theoretical and observational constraints, we explore the allowed parameter space where the Galactic 511 keV $\\gamma$-ray line signal and the dark matter relic can both be explained.

This determines up to which cross sections the dark matter interactions may effectively be disregarded, and when they start playing an essential role, either through collisional damping or through an enhancement of the free-streaming scale.

    "summary": "In a recent paper (arXiv:1106.4546), we introduced \"dynamical dark matter,\" a new framework for dark-matter physics, and outlined its underlying theoretical principles and phenomenological possibilities. Unlike most traditional approaches to the dark-matter problem which hypothesize the existence of one or more stable dark-matter particles, our dynamical dark-matter framework is characterized by the fact that the requirement of stability is replaced by a delicate balancing between cosmological abundances and lifetimes across a vast ensemble of individual dark-matter components. This setup therefore collectively produces a time-varying cosmological dark-matter abundance, and the different dark-matter components can interact and decay throughout the current epoch. While the goal of our previous paper was to introduce the broad theoretical aspects of this framework, the purpose of the current paper is to provide an explicit model of dynamical dark matter and demonstrate that this model satisfies all collider, astrophysical, and cosmological constraints. The results of this paper therefore constitute an \"existence proof\" of the phenomenological viability of our overall dynamical dark-matter framework, and demonstrate that dynamical dark matter is indeed a viable alternative to the traditional paradigm of dark-matter physics. Dynamical dark matter must therefore be considered alongside other approaches to the dark-matter problem, particularly in scenarios involving large extra dimensions or string theory in which there exist large numbers of particles which are neutral under Standard-Model symmetries.",

    "title": "Gravitational Focusing of Wave Dark Matter",
    "summary": "A massive astrophysical object deforms a local distribution of dark matter, resulting in a local overdensity of dark matter. This phenomenon is often referred to as gravitational focusing. In the solar system, the gravitational focusing due to the Sun induces modulations of dark matter signals on terrestrial experiments. We consider the gravitational focusing of a light bosonic dark matter with a mass of less than about 10 eV. The wave nature of such dark matter candidates leads to unique signatures both in the local overdensity and in the spectrum, both of which can be experimentally relevant. We provide a formalism that captures both the gravitational focusing and the stochasticity of wave dark matter, paying particular attention to the similarity and difference to particle dark matter. Distinctive patterns in the density contrast and spectrum are observed when the de Broglie wavelength of dark matter becomes comparable or less than the size of the system and/or when the velocity dispersion of dark matter is sufficiently small. While gravitational focusing effects generally remain at a few percent level for a relaxed halo dark matter component, they could be much larger for dark matter substructures. With a few well-motivated dark matter substructures, we investigate how each substructure responds to the gravitational potential of the Sun. The limit at which wave dark matter behaves similar to particle dark matter is also discussed.",

Nuclear matter (normal matter) as well as the fermionic dark matter sector is considered in a mean field model. We adopt the two fluid formalism to investigate the effect of dark matter on the neutron star properties. In the two fluid picture, there is no direct interaction between the dark matter and the nuclear matter. Rather these two sectors interact only through gravitational interaction. The nuclear matter sector is described by the $\\sigma-\\omega-\\rho$ meson interaction in the \"FSU2R\" parameterization. In the dark matter sector, we use the Bayesian parameter optimization technique to fix the unknown parameters in the dark matter equation of state. In the two fluid picture, we solve the coupled Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations to obtain the mass and radius of dark matter admixed neutron stars (DANSs). We also estimate the effect of the density dependent dark matter sector on the tidal deformability of dark matter admixed neutron stars (DANSs).",

We derive the general cross section for radiative capture into all possible bound states, and point out its non-trivial dependence on the dark matter velocity and the dark photon mass. For indirect detection, our result shows that dark matter annihilation inside bound states can play an important role in enhancing signal rates over the rate for direct dark matter annihilation with Sommerfeld enhancement. The effects are strongest for large dark gauge coupling and when the dark photon mass is smaller than the typical momentum of dark matter in the galaxy. As an example, we show that for thermal dark matter the Fermi gamma ray constraint is substantially increased once bound state effects are taken into account. We also find that bound state effects are not important for dark matter annihilation during the freeze out and recombination epochs.",

    "summary": "In a companion paper (to be presented), lattice field theory methods are used to show that in two-color, two-flavor QCD there are stable nuclear states in the spectrum. As a commonly studied theory of composite dark matter, this motivates the consideration of possible nuclear physics in this and other composite dark sectors. In this work, early Universe cosmology and indirect detection signatures are explored for both symmetric and asymmetric dark matter, highlighting the unique features that arise from considerations of dark nuclei and associated dark nuclear processes. The present day dark matter abundance may be composed of dark nucleons and/or dark nuclei, where the latter are generated through it dark nucleosynthesis. For symmetric dark matter, indirect detection signatures are possible from annihilation, dark nucleosynthesis, and dark nuclear capture and we present a novel explanation of the galactic center gamma ray excess based on the latter. For asymmetric dark matter, dark nucleosynthesis may alter the capture of dark matter in stars, allowing for captured particles to be processed into nuclei and ejected from the star through dark nucleosynthesis in the core. Notably, dark nucleosynthesis realizes a novel mechanism for indirect detection signals of asymmetric dark matter from regions such as the galactic center, without having to rely on a symmetric dark matter component.",

    "summary": "In this paper, a theory of dark energy is proposed that matches dark matter. The relativistic quantum mechanics equations reveal that free particles can have negative energies. We think that the negative energy is the dark energy which behaviors as dark photons with negative energies. In this work, the photon number states are extended to the cases where the photon number can be negative integers, called negative integer photon states, the physical meaning of which are that the photons in such a state are of negative energy, i.e., dark photons. The dark photons constitute dark radiation, also called negative radiation. The formulism of the statistical mechanics and thermodynamics of the dark radiation is presented. This version of dark energy is of negative temperature and negative pressure, the latter regarded as responsible for the accelerate expansion of the universe. It is believed that there is a symmetry of energy-dark energy in the universe. In our previous work, the theory of the motion of the matters with negative kinetic energy was presented. In our opinion, the negative kinetic energy matter is dark matter. In the present work, we demonstrate that the dark substances absorb and release dark energy. In this view, the dark matter and dark energy match. Therefore, there is a symmetry of matter-energy match and dark matter-dark energy match in the universe. We present the reasons why the negative kinetic energy systems and negative radiation are dark to us.",

    "summary": "In the present universe visible and dark matter contribute comparable energy density although they have different properties. This coincidence can be elegantly explained if the dark matter relic density, originating from a dark matter asymmetry, is fully determined by the baryon asymmetry. Thus the dark matter mass is not arbitrary, rather becomes predictive. We realize this scenario in baryon(lepton) number conserving models where two or more neutral singlet scalars decay into two or three baryonic(leptonic) dark matter scalars, and also decay into quarks(leptons) through other on-shell and/or off-shell exotic scalar bilinears. The produced baryon(lepton) asymmetries in the dark matter scalar and in the standard model quarks(leptons) are thus equal and opposite. The dark matter mass can be predicted in a range from a few GeV to a few TeV depending on the baryon(lepton) numbers of the decaying scalars and the dark matter scalar. The dark matter scalar can interact with the visible matter through the exchange of the standard model Higgs boson, opening a window for the dark matter direct detection experiments. These models also provide testable predictions in the searches for the exotic scalar bilinears at LHC.",

A model is introduced in which the cosmic fluid speed of sound squared is defined as a function of its equation of state (EoS) parameter. It is shown how logarithmic part of this function results in dynamical regimes previously not observed in cosmic fluid models. It is shown that in a particular dynamical regime the model behaves as a unification of dark matter and phantom dark energy. Further, it is shown that the model may describe dark matter - dark energy unification in which dark energy asymptotically behaves as dark energy with a constant EoS parameter larger than -1. In a specific parameter regime the unified fluid model also reproduces global expansion similar to $\\Lambda$CDM model with fluid speed of sound vanishing for small scale factor values and being small, or even vanishing, for large scale factor values. Finally, it is shown how the model may be instrumental in describing the cosmic fluid dark matter-dark energy-dark matter unification. Physical constraints on model parameters yielding such transient dark energy behavior are obtained.",

The dark photon, a light gauge boson in the dark sector, can be a relic dark matter if its lifetime is long enough. The main process we consider is a variant of the Primakoff process $f a \\to f \\gamma'$ mediated by a photon, which is possible with the axion--photon--dark photon coupling. The axion is thermalized in the early universe because of the strong interaction and it can contribute to the non-thermal dark photon production through the dark axion portal coupling. It provides a two-component dark matter sector, and the relic density deficit issue of the axion dark matter can be addressed by the compensation with the dark photon. The dark photon dark matter can also address the reported 3.5 keV $X$-ray excess via the $\\gamma' \\to \\gamma a$ decay.",

The dark sector singlet scalar can have a mass of GeV-TeV scale and can have weak scale interactions with the Standard Model(SM) particles.

In Starobinsky inflation model, a sizable amount of dark-sector particle may be produced by the inflaton decay. Thus, a scalar, a fermion or a vector boson in the dark sector may become dark matter. We pay particular attention to the case with dark non-Abelian gauge interaction to make a dark glueball a dark matter candidate. In the minimal setup, we show that it is difficult to explain the observed dark matter abundance without conflicting observational constraints on the coldness and the self-interaction of dark matter.

    "title": "Assessment of Dark Matter Models Using Dark Matter Correlations across   Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies",
    "summary": "The predicted size of dark matter substructures in kilo-parsec scales is model-dependent. Therefore, if the correlations between dark matter mass densities as a function of the distances between them are measured via observations, we can scrutinize dark matter scenarios. In this paper, we present an assessment procedure of dark matter scenarios. First, we use Gaia's data to infer the single-body phase-space density of the stars in the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy. The latter, together with the Jeans equation, after eliminating the gravitational potential using the Poisson equation, reveals the mass density of dark matter as a function of its position in the galaxy. We derive the correlations between dark matter mass densities as a function of distances between them. No statistically significant correlation is observed. Second, for the sake of comparison with the standard cold dark matter, we also compute the correlations between dark matter mass densities in a small halo of the Eagle hydrodynamics simulation. We show that the correlations from the simulation and from Gaia are in agreement. Third, we show that Gaia observations can be used to limit the parameter space of the Ginzburg--Landau statistical field theory of dark matter mass densities and subsequently shrink the parameter space of any dark matter model. As two examples, we show how to leave limitations on (i) a classic gas dark matter and (ii) a superfluid dark matter.",

    "summary": "In existing dark matter models with global symmetries the relic abundance of dark matter is either equal to that of anti-dark matter (thermal WIMP), or vastly larger, with essentially no remaining anti-dark matter (asymmetric dark matter). By exploring the consequences of a primordial asymmetry on the coupled dark matter and anti-dark matter Boltzmann equations we find large regions of parameter space that interpolate between these two extremes. Interestingly, this new asymmetric WIMP framework can accommodate a wide range of dark matter masses and annihilation cross sections. The present-day dark matter population is typically asymmetric, but only weakly so, such that indirect signals of dark matter annihilation are not completely suppressed. We apply our results to existing models, noting that upcoming direct detection experiments will constrain a large region of the relevant parameter space.",

    "summary": "The paucity of old millisecond pulsars observed at the galactic center of the Milky Way could be the result of dark matter accumulating in and destroying neutron stars. In regions of high dark matter density, dark matter clumped in a pulsar can exceed the Schwarzschild limit and collapse into a natal black hole which destroys the pulsar. We examine what dark matter models are consistent with this hypothesis and find regions of parameter space where dark matter accumulation can significantly degrade the neutron star population within the galactic center while remaining consistent with observations of old millisecond pulsars in globular clusters and near the solar position. We identify what dark matter couplings and masses might cause a young pulsar at the galactic center to unexpectedly extinguish. Finally, we find that pulsar collapse age scales inversely with the dark matter density and linearly with the dark matter velocity dispersion. This implies that maximum pulsar age is spatially dependent on position within the dark matter halo of the Milky Way. In turn, this pulsar age spatial dependence will be dark matter model dependent.",

    "summary": "We review the phenomenology of SUSY dark matter in various versions of MSSM, with universal and nonuniversal gaugino masses at the GUT scale. We start with the universal case (CMSSM), where the cosmologically compatible dark matter relic density is achieved only over some narrow regions of parameter space, involving some fine-tuning. Moreover, most of these regions are seriously challenged by the constraints from collider and direct dark matter detection experiments. Then we consider some simple and predictive nonuniversal gaugino mass models, based on SU(5) GUT. Several of these models offer viable SUSY dark matter candidates, which are compatible with the cosmic dark matter relic density and the above mentioned experimental constraints. They can be probed at the present and future collider and dark matter search experiments. Finally, we consider the nonuniversal gaugino mass model arising from anomaly mediated SUSY breaking. In this case the cosmologically compatible dark matter relic density requires dark matter mass of a few TeV, which puts it beyond the scope of collider and direct dark matter detection experiments. However, it has interesting predictions for some indirect dark matter detection experiments.",

Inflation driven by the two-component dark matter fields can be divided into two cases, singlet dark matter inflation and mixed dark matter inflation, where both two-component play the role of inflaton in the latter case. For dark matter, we focus on the mixed dark matter inflation case. We show a viable parameter space that satisfies the theoretical and dark matter relic density constraint in the case of successful inflation. It turns out that the dark matter density is dominated by the light component, which is consistent with the feature of the $Z_5$ model of the two-component dark matter.",

In this study, we examine non-radial oscillations in neutron stars containing self-interacting dark matter, which interacts with normal matter exclusively via gravity. To achieve this, we derive a new set of perturbation equations for a multi-fluid system under the Cowling approximation. Using these equations, we analyze the oscillation spectra and identify additional modes associated with dark matter, alongside those of normal matter. We find that the frequency behavior becomes more intricate with increasing self-coupling strength of dark matter, particularly as the stellar structure transitions between dark core and dark halo configurations, depending on the total stellar mass. Nevertheless, we find that in the dark core structure, the fundamental ($f$) mode frequencies associated with dark matter exceed those of normal matter, at least when the central energy densities of both fluids are equal. Furthermore, we find that the $f$-mode frequencies associated with normal matter in dark core configurations adhere to a universal relation between the mass-scaled frequency and stellar compactness.",

The dark energy quasiparticle with the mass ~ 15 GeV is consistent with the 7-year WMAP and other data. The quasiparticles can decay with violation of CP-invariance into baryons, leptons, and dark matter. The WIMP mass ~ 5 GeV corresponds to observed values of baryon and dark matter energy densities. Such a mass agrees with the observations of CoGeNT, DAMA, and CDMS. Quasiparticles of dark energy can be registered as a constant background of radiation with the frequency ~ 3.64 x 10^{24} 1/s. Dark matter particles must exhibit themselves in the form of signals with the frequency ~ 1.21 x 10^{24} 1/s of radiation from galaxy clusters where the intensive gravitational fields produced by dark matter exist.",

    "summary": "We introduce a new mechanism for the simultaneous generation of baryon and dark matter asymmetries through ultraviolet-dominated freeze-in scatterings. The mechanism relies on heavy Majorana neutrinos that connect the visible Standard Model sector to a dark sector through the neutrino portal. Following reheating of the visible sector to a temperature well below the heavy neutrino masses, we show that 2-to-2 scattering processes can populate the dark sector and generate both baryon and dark matter asymmetries. In some parameter regions, the dominant source of baryon asymmetry can be charge transfer from the dark sector, a process we call dark wash-in. We also demonstrate that annihilation of the dark matter to massless states within the dark sector can deplete the symmetric population without destroying the net baryon charge to leave only an asymmetric dark matter abundance today. Depending on the specific model parameters, the observed baryon and dark matter abundances can be attained with heavy neutrino masses $M_N \\gtrsim 10^{10}$ GeV, and dark matter masses in the range 0.1 GeV $\\lesssim m_\\chi \\lesssim 10^3$ GeV if the dark matter relic abundance is mainly asymmetric and even lower masses if it is symmetric.",

With a KeV scale mass splitting between the two components of the Pseudo-Dirac dark matter, the slightly excited component can down-scatter on electrons. The desired dark matter masses are about 10 GeV with a 4 KeV mass-splitting and unity coupling to electrons, which generate the observed XENON1T recoil events, give the appropriate dark matter relic abundance and satisfy collider search limits.",

    "summary": "Dissipative dark matter, where dark matter particles interact with a massless (or very light) boson, is studied. Such dark matter can arise in simple hidden sector gauge models, including those featuring an unbroken $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry, leading to a dark photon. Previous work has shown that such models can not only explain the LSS and CMB, but potentially also dark matter phenomena on small scales, such as the inferred cored structure of dark matter halos. In this picture, dark matter halos of disk galaxies not only cool via dissipative interactions but are also heated via ordinary supernovae (facilitated by an assumed photon - dark photon kinetic mixing interaction). This interaction between the dark matter halo and ordinary baryons, a very special feature of these types of models, plays a critical role in governing the physical properties of the dark matter halo. Here, we further study the implications of this type of dissipative dark matter for disk galaxies. Building on earlier work, we develop a simple formalism which aims to describe the effects of dissipative dark matter in a fairly model independent way. This formalism is then applied to generic disk galaxies. We also consider specific examples, including NGC 1560 and a sample of dwarf galaxies from the LITTLE THINGS survey. We find that dissipative dark matter, as developed here, does a fairly good job accounting for the rotation curves of the galaxies considered. Not only does dissipative dark matter explain the linear rise of the rotational velocity of dwarf galaxies at small radii, but it can also explain the observed wiggles in rotation curves which are known to be correlated with corresponding features in the disk gas distribution.",

    "summary": "The nature of dark matter remains a central question in particle physics, cosmology, and astrophysics. The prevailing hypothesis postulates that dark matter consists of particles that interact only weakly with Standard Model particles. However, the knowledge of dark matter properties beyond these interactions is limited. This study explores a scenario involving a dark photon as a mediator between dark matter and the Standard Model, akin to the photon's role in electromagnetism. Recent cosmological and experimental evidence impose constraints on this scenario, focusing on results from direct detection experiments such as PICO-60, XENON-1T, and PANDAX-4T. The results reveal severe constraints, effectively closing the window for laboratory searches for dark photons as mediators between the Standard Model and the dark sector (dark electrons) in the secluded dark matter scenario. The findings underscore the need for alternative explanations and offer fresh perspectives on the ongoing quest to understand dark matter and its interactions since they are nearly independent of the dark electron fraction content for the total dark matter. This analysis significantly narrows down the parameter space for thermal dark matter scenarios involving a dark photon portal, reinforcing the urgency of exploring alternative models and designing new experiments to unravel the mysteries surrounding the nature of dark matter.",

For this purpose, the linear growth of density perturbation in the presence of dark matter pressure is calculated. In addition, the matter transfer function considering the dark matter pressure, as well as the linear matter power spectrum in the presence of the dark matter pressure are presented.

The critical mass for the appearance of quark matter decreases with increasing dark matter content. We introduce the concept of \"masquerading hybrid stars\", where dark matter admixed stars exhibit similar mass-radius relations to purely hadronic stars, making it challenging to distinguish between them based solely on these parameters. Additionally, we identify a unique class of objects termed \"dark oysters\", characterized by a large dark matter halo and a small normal matter core, highlighting the diverse structural possibilities for compact stars influenced by dark matter.",

    "summary": "We propose a scenario with a fermion dark matter, where the dark matter particle used to be the Dirac fermion, but it takes the form of the Majorana fermion at a late time. The relic number density of the dark matter is determined by the dark matter asymmetry generated through the same mechanism as leptogenesis when the dark matter was the Dirac fermion. After efficient dark matter annihilation processes have frozen out, a phase transition of a scalar field takes place and generates Majorana mass terms to turn the dark matter particle into the Majorana fermion. In order to address this scenario in detail, we propose two simple models. The first one is based on the Standard Model (SM) gauge group and the dark matter originates the $SU(2)_L$ doublet Dirac fermion, analogous to the Higgsino-like neutralino in supersymmetric models. We estimate the spin-independent/dependent elastic scattering cross sections of this late-time Majorana dark matter with a proton and find the possibility to discover it by the direct and/or indirect dark matter search experiments in the near future. The second model is based on the $B-L$ gauged extension of the SM, where the dark matter is a SM singlet. Although this model is similar to the so-called Higgs portal dark matter scenario, the spin-independent elastic scattering cross section can be large enough to detect this dark matter in future experiments.",

We find that the local dark matter velocity distribution of the Milky Way-like halos in the simulations with dark matter self-interactions and baryons are generally similar to those extracted from cold collisionless dark matter simulations with baryons. In both cases, the local dark matter speed distributions agree well with their best fit Maxwellian distributions. Including baryons in the simulations with or without dark matter self-interactions increases the local dark matter density and shifts the dark matter speed distributions to higher speeds. To study the implications for direct detection, we compute the dark matter halo integrals obtained directly from the simulations and compare them to those obtained from the best fit Maxwellian velocity distribution. We find that a Maxwellian distribution provides a good fit to the halo integrals of most halos, without any significant difference between the results of different dark matter self-interaction models.",

These crossing relations lie at the heart of the celebrated complementarity which underpins different existing dark-matter search techniques and strategies. In multi-component theories of dark matter, by contrast, there can be many different dark-matter components with differing masses. This then opens up a new, \"diagonal\" direction for dark-matter complementarity: the possibility of dark-matter decay from heavier to lighter dark-matter components. In this work, we discuss how this new direction may be correlated with the others, and demonstrate that the enhanced complementarity which emerges can be an important ingredient in probing and constraining the parameter spaces of such models.",

We discuss the capture process in the case where the dark matter is a Dirac fermion and the background halo consists of equal amounts of dark matter and anti-dark matter. By considering the case where dark matter and anti-dark matter have different cross sections on solar nuclei as well as the case where the capture process is considered to be a Poisson process, we find that a significant asymmetry between the captured dark particles and anti-particles is possible even for an annihilation cross section in the range expected for thermal relic dark matter. Since the captured number of particles are competitive with asymmetric dark matter models in a large range of parameter space, one may expect solar physics to be altered by the capture of Dirac dark matter. It is thus possible that solutions to the solar composition problem may be searched for in these type of models.",

    "summary": "We push ahead the idea developed in [24], that some fraction of the dark matter and the dark energy can be explained as a relativistic effect. The inhomogeneity matter generates gravitational distortions, which are general relativistically retarded. These combine in a magnification effect since the past matter density, which generated the distortion we feel now, is greater than the present one. The non negligible effect on the averaged expansion of the universe contributes both to the estimations of the dark matter and to the dark energy, so that the parameters of the Cosmological Standard Model need some corrections.   In this second work we apply the previously developed framework to relativistic models of the universe. It results that one parameter remain free, so that more solutions are possible, as function of inhomogeneity. One of these fully explains the dark energy, but requires more dark matter than the Cosmological Standard Model (91% of the total matter). Another solution fully explains the dark matter, but requires more dark energy than the Cosmological Standard Model (15% more). A third noteworthy solution explains a consistent part of the dark matter (it would be 63% of the total matter) and also some of the dark energy (4%).",

    "title": "Nonthermal production of dark radiation and dark matter",
    "summary": "Dark matter may be coupled to dark radiation: light degrees of freedom that mediate forces between dark sector particles. Cosmological constraints favor dark radiation that is colder than Standard Model radiation. In models with fixed couplings between dark matter and the Standard Model, these constraints can be difficult to satisfy if thermal equilibrium is assumed in the early universe. We construct a model of asymmetric reheating of the visible and dark sectors from late decays of a long-lived particle (for instance, a modulus). We show, as a proof-of-principle, that such a model can populate a sufficiently cold dark sector while also generating baryon and dark matter asymmetries through the out of equilibrium decay. We frame much of our discussion in terms of the scenario of dissipative dark matter, as in the Double-Disk Dark Matter scenario. However, our results may also be of interest for other scenarios like the Twin Higgs model that are in danger of overproducing dark radiation due to nonnegligible dark-visible couplings.",

    "summary": "Ultralight dark photon dark matter features distinctive cosmological and astrophysical signatures and is also supported by a burgeoning direct-detection program searching for its kinetic mixing with the ordinary photon over a wide mass range. Dark photons, however, cannot necessarily constitute the dark matter in all of this parameter space. In minimal models where the dark photon mass arises from a dark Higgs mechanism, early-Universe dynamics can easily breach the regime of validity of the low-energy effective theory for a massive vector field. In the process, the dark sector can collapse into a cosmic string network, precluding dark photons as viable dark matter. We establish the general conditions under which dark photon production avoids significant backreaction on the dark Higgs and identify regions of parameter space that naturally circumvent these constraints. After surveying implications for known dark photon production mechanisms, we propose novel models that set well-motivated experimental targets across much of the accessible parameter space. We also discuss complementary cosmological and astrophysical signatures that can probe the dark sector physics responsible for dark photon production.",

    "summary": "We propose a new interacting dark sector model, Stepped Partially Acoustic Dark Matter (SPartAcous), that can simultaneously address the two most important tensions in current cosmological data, the $H_0$ and $S_8$ problems. As in the Partially Acoustic Dark Matter (PAcDM) scenario, this model features a subcomponent of dark matter that interacts with dark radiation at high temperatures, suppressing the growth of structure at small scales and thereby addressing the $S_8$ problem. However, in the SPartAcous model, the dark radiation includes a component with a light mass that becomes non-relativistic close to the time of matter-radiation equality. As this light component annihilates away, the remaining dark radiation heats up and its interactions with dark matter decouple. The heating up of the dark sector results in a step-like increase in the relative energy density in dark radiation, significantly reducing the $H_0$ tension, while the decoupling of dark matter and dark radiation ensures that the power spectrum at larger scales is identical to $\\Lambda$CDM.",

    "summary": "We explore some of the consequences of Dark Matter-photon interactions on structure formation, focusing on the evolution of cosmological perturbations and performing both an analytical and a numerical study. We compute the cosmic microwave background anisotropies and matter power spectrum in this class of models. We find, as the main result, that when Dark Matter and photons are coupled, Dark Matter perturbations can experience a new damping regime in addition to the usual collisional Silk damping effect. Such Dark Matter particles (having quite large photon interactions) behave like Cold Dark Matter or Warm Dark Matter as far as the cosmic microwave background anisotropies or matter power spectrum are concerned, respectively. These Dark Matter-photon interactions leave specific imprints at sufficiently small scales on both of these two spectra, which may allow to put new constraints on the acceptable photon-Dark Matter interactions. Under the conservative assumption that the abundance of 10^12 M_sol galaxies is correctly given by Cold Dark Matter, and without any knowledge of the abundance of smaller objects, we obtain the limit on the ratio of the Dark Matter-photon cross section to the Dark Matter mass sigma_{gamma-DM} / m_DM < 10^-6 sigma_Thomson / 100 GeV \\sim 6 * 10^-33 cm^2 GeV^-1 .",

    "title": "Perturbative Unitarity Constraints on Gauge Portals",
    "summary": "Dark matter that was once in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model is generally prohibited from obtaining all of its mass from the electroweak phase transition. This implies a new scale of physics and mediator particles to facilitate dark matter annihilation. In this work, we focus on dark matter that annihilates through a generic gauge boson portal. We show how partial wave unitarity places upper bounds on the dark gauge boson, dark Higgs and dark matter masses. Outside of well-defined fine-tuned regions, we find an upper bound of 9 TeV for the dark matter mass when the dark Higgs and dark gauge bosons both facilitate the dark matter annihilations. In this scenario, the upper bound on the dark Higgs and dark gauge boson masses are 10 TeV and 16 TeV, respectively. When only the dark gauge boson facilitates dark matter annihilations, we find an upper bound of 3 TeV and 6 TeV for the dark matter and dark gauge boson, respectively. Overall, using the gauge portal as a template, we describe a method to not only place upper bounds on the dark matter mass but also on the new particles with Standard Model quantum numbers. We briefly discuss the reach of future accelerator, direct and indirect detection experiments for this class of models.",
