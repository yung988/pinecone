The main idea is that many results of the method of complex germ and of perturbative quantum field theory can be made more simple and natural if instead of the algebra of (pseudo)differential operators one uses the Weyl algebra (operators with Weyl symbols) with the Moyal *-product. Section 1, devoted to quantum mechanics, contains a closed mathematical description of the Maslov--Shvedov method in the theory of Schrodinger equation, including the method of canonical operator. In particular, it contains a new simple definition of the Maslov index modulo 4. Section 2, devoted to quantum field theory, contains a logically self-consistent exposition of the main results of perturbative quantum field theory not using the subtraction of infinities from the quantum Hamiltonian of free field and normal ordering of operators. It also contains a result (dynamical evolution in quantum field theory in quasiclassical approximation) close to the Maslov--Shvedov quantum field theory complex germ.",

    "summary": "Inspired by classical (\"actual\") Quantum Theory over $\\mathbb{C}$ and Modal Quantum Theory (MQT), which is a model of Quantum Theory over certain finite fields, we introduce General Quantum Theory as a Quantum Theory -- in the K{\\o}benhavn interpretation -- over general division rings with involution, in which the inner product \"is\" a $(\\sigma,1)$-Hermitian form $\\varphi$. This unites all known such approaches in one and the same theory, and we show that many of the known results such as no-cloning, no-deleting, quantum teleportation and super-dense quantum coding, which are known in classical Quantum Theory over $\\mathbb{C}$ and in some MQTs, hold for any General Quantum Theory. On the other hand, in many General Quantum Theories, a geometrical object which we call \"quantum kernel\" arises, which is invariant under the unitary group $\\mathbf{U}(V,\\varphi)$, and which carries the geometry of a so-called polar space. We use this object to construct new quantum (teleportation) coding schemes, which mix quantum theory with the geometry of the quantum kernel (and the action of the unitary group). We also show that in characteristic $0$, every General Quantum Theory over an algebraically closed field behaves like classical Quantum Theory over $\\mathbb{C}$ at many levels, and that all such theories share one model, which we pin down as the \"minimal model,\" which is countable and defined over $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}$. Moreover, to make the analogy with classical Quantum Theory even more striking, we show that Born's rule holds in any such theory. So all such theories are not modal at all. Finally, we obtain an extension theory for General Quantum Theories in characteristic $0$ which allows one to extend any such theory over algebraically closed fields (such as classical complex Quantum Theory) to larger theories in which a quantum kernel is present.",

Such a theory is described on the configuration space of fields rather than spacetime, which is a third quantized theory. So, both string theory and group field theory are third-quantized theories. Thus, using axioms of string field theory, we motivate similar axioms for group field theory. Then, using the structure of these axioms for string field theory and group field theory, we identify general features of axioms for any such third quantized theory of quantum gravity. Thus, we show that such third-quantized theories of quantum gravity can be formulated as formal axiomatic systems. We then analyze the consequences of G\\\"odel theorems on such third quantized theories. We thus address problems of consistency and completeness of any third quantized theories of quantum gravity.",

We consider the domain of non-relativistic quantum theory, relativistic quantum theory and quantum field theory, and in each domain we consider the possibility of formulating a pilot-wave interpretation. For non-relativistic quantum theory a pilot-wave interpretation in terms of particle beables can readily be formulated. But this interpretation can in general not straightforwardly be generalized to relativistic wave equations. The problems which prevent us from devising a pilot-wave interpretation for relativistic wave equations also plague the standard quantum mechanical interpretation, where these problems led to the conception of quantum field theory. Therefore most of our attention is focussed on the construction of a pilot-wave interpretation for quantum field theory. We thereby favour the field beable approach, developed amongst others by Bohm, Hiley, Holland, Kaloyerou and Valentini. Although the field beable approach can be successfully applied to bosonic quantum field theory, it seems not straightforward to do so for fermionic quantum field theory.",

    "summary": "Quantum field theory can be a new medium for communication through quantum energy teleportation. We performed a demonstration of quantum energy teleportation with a relativistic fermionic field theory of self-coupled fermions, called the massive Thirring model. Our results reveal that there is a close relation between the amount of energy teleported and the phase diagram of the theory. In particular, it is shown that the teleported energy peaks near the phase transition points. The results provide new implications for phase diagrams of field theory in terms of quantum communication and quantum computing.",

In this work, we study thermal field theories involving only fermions using quantum algorithms. We first delve into the presentations of fermion fields via qubits on digital quantum computers alongside the quantum algorithms such as quantum imaginary time evolutions employed to evaluate thermal properties of generic quantum field theories. Specifically, we show numerical results such as the thermal distribution and the energy density of thermal field theories for Majorana fermions in 1+1 dimensions using quantum simulators. In addition to free field theory, we also study the effects of interactions resulting from coupling with a spatially homogeneous Majorana field. In both cases, we show analytically that thermal properties of the system can be described using phase-space distributions, and the quantum simulation results agree with analytical and semiclassical expectations. Our work is an important step to understand thermal fixed points, preparing for quantum simulation of thermalization in real time.",

Our aim here is to establish a network theory for quantum transport systems where typically the mediating fields between systems are bi-directional. Mathematically this leads us to study quantum feedback networks where fields arrive at ports in input-output pairs, which is then just a specially case of the uni-directional theory. However, it is conceptually important to develop this theory in the context of quantum transport theory, and the resulting theory extends traditional approaches which tends to view the components in quantum transport as scatterers for the various fields, in the process allows us to consider emission and absorption of field quanta by these components. The quantum feedback network theory is applicable to both Bose and Fermi fields, moreover it applies to nonlinear dynamics for the component systems. In this first paper on the subject, we advance the general theory, but study the case of linear passive quantum components in some detail.",

Background independence is the statement that these different superstring field theories are related to each other by field redefinition. We prove background independence of closed superstring field theory.",

    "title": "Quantum Field Theory Is Not Merely Quantum Mechanics Applied to Low   Energy Effective Degrees of Freedom",
    "summary": "It is commonly assumed that quantum field theory arises by applying ordinary quantum mechanics to the low energy effective degrees of freedom of a more fundamental theory defined at ultra-high-energy/short-wavelength scales. We shall argue here that, even for free quantum fields, there are holistic aspects of quantum field theory that cannot be properly understood in this manner. Specifically, the ``subtractions'' needed to define nonlinear polynomial functions of a free quantum field in curved spacetime are quite simple and natural from the quantum field theoretic point of view, but are at best extremely ad hoc and unnatural if viewed as independent renormalizations of individual modes of the field. We illustrate this point by contrasting the analysis of the Casimir effect, the renormalization of the stress-energy tensor in time-dependent spacetimes, and anomalies from the point of quantum field theory and from the point of view of quantum mechanics applied to the independent low energy modes of the field. Some implications for the cosmological constant problem are discussed.",

The free fields are employed to form what we consider to be the simplest examples of interacting fields which we then use to construct Hamiltonian densities. Scattering operators are defined in terms of these densities and are employed to construct scattering probabilities. Although our definition of a scattering operator is not the usual \"second-quantization\" definition we believe it is simpler and more natural. Emphasis is placed on finding the eigenstructures of toy quantum fields.",

We will see that the group field theories investigated in the literature to date are, when judged from the position of quantum field theory, an unusual manifestation of quantum dynamics. They are one in which the Hadamard function for the field theory propagates a-causally the physical degrees of freedom of quantum gravity. This is fine if we wish to define a scalar product on the physical state space, but it is not what we generally think of as originating directly from a field theory. We propose a model in 3d more in line with standard quantum field theory, and therefore the field theory precipitates causal dynamics. Thereafter, we couple the model to point matter, and extract from the GFT the effective non-commutative field theory describing the matter dynamics on a quantum gravity background. We identify the symmetries of our new model and clarify their meaning in the GFT setting. We are aided in this process by identifying the category theory foundations of this GFT which, moreover, propel us towards a categorified version for the 4d case.",

In this monograph, using a new coend definition of the Boardman-Vogt construction of a colored operad, we define homotopy algebraic quantum field theories and homotopy prefactorization algebras and investigate their homotopy coherent structures. Homotopy coherent diagrams, homotopy inverses, A-infinity-algebras, E-infinity-algebras, and E-infinity-modules arise naturally in this context. In particular, each homotopy algebraic quantum field theory has the structure of a homotopy coherent diagram of A-infinity-algebras and satisfies a homotopy coherent version of the causality axiom. When the time-slice axiom is defined for algebraic quantum field theory, a homotopy coherent version of the time-slice axiom is satisfied by each homotopy algebraic quantum field theory. Over each topological space, every homotopy prefactorization algebra has the structure of a homotopy coherent diagram of E-infinity-modules over an E-infinity-algebra. To compare the two approaches, we construct a comparison morphism from the colored operad for (homotopy) prefactorization algebras to the colored operad for (homotopy) algebraic quantum field theories and study the induced adjunctions on algebras.",

    "summary": "We expect quantum field theories for matter to acquire intricate corrections due to their coupling to quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field. This can be precisely worked out in 3d quantum gravity: after integrating out quantum gravity, matter fields are effectively described as noncommutative quantum field theories, with quantum-deformed Lorentz symmetries. An open question remains: Are such theories unitary or not? On the one hand, since these are effective field theories obtained after integrating out high energy degrees of freedom, we may expect the loss of unitarity. On the other hand, as rigorously defined field theories built with Lorentz symmetries and standing on their own, we naturally expect the conservation of unitarity. In an effort to settle this issue, we explicitly check unitarity for a scalar field at one-loop level in both Euclidean and Lorentzian space-time signatures. We find that unitarity requires adding an extra-term to the propagator of the noncommutative theory, corresponding to a massless mode and given by a representation with vanishing Plancherel measure, thus usually ignored in spinfoam path integrals for quantum gravity. This indicates that the inclusion of matter in spinfoam models, and more generally in quantum gravity, might be more subtle than previously thought.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we further develop the analysis started in an earlier paper on the inequivalence of certain quantum field theories on noncommutative spacetimes constructed using twisted fields. The issue is of physical importance. Thus it is well known that the commutation relations among spacetime coordinates, which define a noncommutative spacetime, do not constrain the deformation induced on the algebra of functions uniquely. Such deformations are all mathematically equivalent in a very precise sense. Here we show how this freedom at the level of deformations of the algebra of functions can fail on the quantum field theory side. In particular, quantum field theory on the Wick-Voros and Moyal planes are shown to be inequivalent in a few different ways. Thus quantum field theory calculations on these planes will lead to different physics even though the classical theories are equivalent. This result is reminiscent of chiral anomaly in gauge theories and has obvious physical consequences. The construction of quantum field theories on the Wick-Voros plane has new features not encountered for quantum field theories on the Moyal plane. In fact it seems impossible to construct a quantum field theory on the Wick-Voros plane which satisfies all the properties needed of field theories on noncommutative spaces. The Moyal twist seems to have unique features which make it a preferred choice for the construction of a quantum field theory on a noncommutative spacetime.",

    "title": "Fermionic quantum field theories as probabilistic cellular automata",
    "summary": "A class of fermionic quantum field theories with interactions is shown to be equivalent to probabilistic cellular automata, namely cellular automata with a probability distribution for the initial states. Probabilistic cellular automata on a one-dimensional lattice are equivalent to two - dimensional quantum field theories for fermions. They can be viewed as generalized Ising models on a square lattice and therefore as classical statistical systems. As quantum field theories they are quantum systems. Thus quantum mechanics emerges from classical statistics. As an explicit example for an interacting fermionic quantum field theory we describe a type of discretized Thirring model as a cellular automaton. The updating rule of the automaton is encoded in the step evolution operator that can be expressed in terms of fermionic annihilation and creation operators. The complex structure of quantum mechanics is associated to particle -- hole transformations. The naive continuum limit exhibits Lorentz symmetry. We exploit the equivalence to quantum field theory in order to show how quantum concepts as wave functions, density matrix, non-commuting operators for observables and similarity transformations are convenient and useful concepts for the description of probabilistic cellular automata.",

    "summary": "Motivated by the question of exploring the \"theory space\" of quantum field theories, we review the concept of \"decomposing\" and \"gluing\" quantum field theories. We explain this in the context of three-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric domain walls inside four-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=2$ theories, where the latter arise from the 6d $(2,0)$ theory compactified on Riemann surfaces. We find that $S^3$ partition functions of the three-dimensional theories can be interpreted as partition functions of a three-dimensional topological quantum field theory.",

We use here a nonlocal quantum field theory (NLQFT) which is finite, satisfies Poincar\\'e invariance, unitarity and microscopic causality. This nonlocal quantum field theory associates infinite derivative entire functions with propagators and vertices. We focus on proving causality and discussing its importance when constructing a relativistic field theory. We formulate scalar field theory using the functional integral in order to characterize quantum entanglement and the entanglement entropy of the theory. Using the replica trick, we compute the entanglement entropy for the theory in 3 + 1 dimensions on a cone. The result is free of UV divergences and we recover the area law.",
